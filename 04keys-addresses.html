<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of Ethereum&#x2019;s foundational technologies is <em>cryptography</em>, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means &quot;secret writing&quot; in Greek, but the study of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as <em>encryption</em>. Cryptography can, for example, also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (e.g., with a digital signature), or to prove the authenticity of data (e.g., with digital fingerprints, also known as &quot;hashes&quot;). These types of cryptographic proofs are mathematical tools critical to the operation of the Ethereum platform (and, indeed, all blockchain systems), and are also extensively used in Ethereum applications. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that, at the time of publication, no part of the Ethereum protocol involves encryption; that is to say all communications with the Ethereum platform and between nodes (including transaction data) are unencrypted and can (necessarily) be read by anyone. This is so everyone can verify the correctness of state updates and consensus can be reached. In the future, advanced cryptographic tools, such as zero knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, will be available that will allow for some encrypted calculations to be recorded on the blockchain while still enabling consensus; however, while provision has been made for them, they have yet to be deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we will introduce some of the cryptography used in Ethereum: namely public key cryptography (PKC), which is used to control ownership of funds, in the form of private keys and addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="keys_addresses_intro">Keys and Addresses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we saw earlier in the book, Ethereum has two different types of accounts: <em>externally owned accounts</em> (EOAs) and <em>contracts</em>. Ownership of ether by EOAs is established through digital <em>private keys</em>, <em>Ethereum addresses</em>, and <em>digital signatures</em>. The private keys are at the heart of all user interaction with Ethereum. In fact, account addresses are derived directly from private keys: a private key uniquely determines a single Ethereum address, also known as an <em>account</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Private keys are not used directly in the Ethereum system in any way; they are never transmitted or stored on Ethereum. That is to say that private keys should remain private and never appear in messages passed to the network, nor should they be stored on-chain; only account addresses and digital signatures are ever transmitted and stored on the Ethereum system. For more information on how to keep private keys safe and secure, see <a href="#control_responsibility">[control_responsibility]</a> and <a href="#wallets_chapter">[wallets_chapter]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access and control of funds is achieved with digital signatures, which are also created using the private key. Ethereum transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain. Anyone with a copy of a private key has control of the corresponding account and any ether it holds. Assuming a user keeps their private key safe, the digital signatures in Ethereum transactions prove the true owner of the funds, because they prove ownership of the private key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In public key cryptography&#x2013;based systems, such as that used by Ethereum, keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number, and the private key as similar to the secret PIN; it is the latter that provides control over the account, and the former that identifies it to others. The private keys themselves are very rarely seen by Ethereum users; for the most part, they are stored (in encrypted form) in special files and managed by Ethereum wallet software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the payment portion of an Ethereum transaction, the intended recipient is represented by an Ethereum address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary account details of a bank transfer. As we will see in more detail shortly, an Ethereum address for an EOA is generated from the public key portion of a key pair. However, not all Ethereum addresses represent public&#x2013;private key pairs; they can also represent contracts, which, as we will see in <a href="#smart_contracts_chapter">[smart_contracts_chapter]</a>, are not backed by private keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the rest of this chapter, we will first explore basic cryptography in a bit more detail and explain the mathematics used in Ethereum. Then we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed.  Finally, we will review the various encoding formats used to represent private keys, public keys, and addresses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="pkc">Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public key cryptography (also called &quot;asymmetric cryptography&quot;) is a core part of modern-day information security. The key exchange protocol, first published in the 1970s by Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie, and Ralph Merkle, was a monumental breakthrough that incited the first big wave of public interest in the field of cryptography. Before the 1970s, strong cryptographic knowledge was kept secret by <span class="keep-together">governments</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public key cryptography uses unique keys to secure information. These keys are based on mathematical functions that have a special property: it is easy to calculate them, but hard to calculate their inverse. Based on these functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures, which are secured by the laws of mathematics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, multiplying two large prime numbers together is trivial. But given the product of two large primes, it is very difficult to find the prime factors (a problem called <em>prime factorization</em>). Let&#x2019;s say we present the number 8,018,009 and tell you it is the product of two primes. Finding those two primes is much harder for you than it was for me to multiply them to produce 8,018,009.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these mathematical functions can be inverted easily if you know some secret information. In the preceding example, if I tell you that one of the prime factors is 2,003, you can trivially find the other one with a simple division: 8,018,009 &#xF7; 2,003 = 4,003. Such functions are often called <em>trapdoor functions</em> because they are very difficult to invert unless you are given a piece of secret information that can be used as a shortcut to reverse the function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more advanced category of mathematical functions that is useful in cryptography is based on arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve. In elliptic curve arithmetic, multiplication modulo a prime is simple but division (the inverse) is practically impossible. This is called the <em>discrete logarithm problem</em> and there are currently no known trapdoors. <em>Elliptic curve cryptography</em> is used extensively in modern computer systems and is the basis of Ethereum&#x2019;s (and other cryptocurrencies&apos;) use of private keys and digital signatures.</p>

<p>In Ethereum, we use public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography) to create the public&#x2013;private key pair we have been talking about in this chapter. They are considered a &quot;pair&quot; because the public key is derived from the private key. Together, they represent an Ethereum account by providing, respectively, a publicly accessible account handle (the address) and private control over access to any ether in the account and over any authentication the account needs when using smart contracts. The private key controls access by being the unique piece of information needed to create <em>digital signatures</em>, which are required to sign transactions to spend any funds in the account. Digital signatures are also used to authenticate owners or users of contracts, as we will see in <a href="#smart_contracts_chapter">[smart_contracts_chapter]</a>.</p>

<p>A digital signature can be created to sign any message. For Ethereum transactions, the details of the transaction itself are used as the message. The mathematics of cryptography&#x2014;in this case, elliptic curve cryptography&#x2014;provides a way for the message (i.e., the transaction details) to be combined with the private key to create a code that can only be produced with knowledge of the private key. That
code is called the digital signature. Note that an Ethereum transaction is basically a request to access a particular account with a particular Ethereum address. When a transaction is sent to the Ethereum network in order to move funds or interact with smart contracts, it needs to be sent with a digital signature created with the private key corresponding to the Ethereum address in question. Elliptic curve mathematics means that <em>anyone</em> can verify that a transaction is valid, by checking that the digital signature matches the transaction details <em>and</em> the Ethereum address to which access is being requested. The verification doesn&#x2019;t involve the private key at all; that remains private. However, the verification process determines beyond doubt that the transaction could have only come from someone with the private key that corresponds to the public key behind the Ethereum address. This is the &quot;magic&quot; of public key cryptography.</p>

<h4 id="generating_private_key">Generating a Private Key from a Random Number</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating an Ethereum private key essentially involves picking a number between 1 and 2<sup>256</sup>. The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or deterministic. Ethereum software uses the underlying operating system&#x2019;s random number generator to produce 256 random bits. Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds, or press random keys on your keyboard. An alternative could be cosmic radiation noise on the computer&#x2019;s microphone channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More precisely, a private key can be any nonzero number up to a very large number slightly less than 2<sup>256</sup>&#x2014;a huge 78-digit number, roughly 1.158 * 10<sup>77</sup>. The exact number shares the first 38 digits with 2<sup>256</sup> and is defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in Ethereum (see <a href="#elliptic_curve">Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained</a>). To create a private key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is within the valid range. In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding an even larger string of random bits (collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness) into a 256-bit hash algorithm such as Keccak-256 or SHA-256, both of which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number. If the result is within the valid range, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.</p>

For comparison, the visible universe is estimated to contain 10<sup>80</sup> atoms. Thus, there are almost enough private keys to give every atom in the universe an Ethereum account.

<p>Note that the private key generation process is an offline one; it does not require any communication with the Ethereum network, or indeed any communication with anyone at all. As such, in order to pick a number that no one else will ever pick, it needs to be truly random. If you choose the number yourself, the chance that someone else will try it (and then run off with your ether) is too high. Using a bad random number generator (like the pseudorandom rand function in most programming languages) is even worse, because it is even more obvious and even easier to replicate. Just like with passwords for online accounts, the private key needs to be unguessable. Fortunately, you never need to remember your private key, so you can take the best possible approach for picking it: namely, true randomness.</p>

<h4 id="EC_math">Elliptic Curve Arithmetic Operations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of elliptic curve math looks and works very much like the integer arithmetic we learned at school. Specifically, we can define an addition operator, which instead of jumping along the number line is jumping to other points on the curve. Once we have the addition operator, we can also define multiplication of a point and a whole number, which is equivalent to repeated addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Elliptic curve addition is defined such that given two points <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> on the elliptic curve, there is a third point <em>P</em><sub>3</sub> = <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>, also on the elliptic curve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Geometrically, this third point <em>P</em><sub>3</sub> is calculated by drawing a line between <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place (amazingly). Call this point <em>P</em><sub>3</sub>&apos; = (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). Then reflect in the x-axis to get <em>P</em><sub>3</sub> = (<em>x</em>, <em>&#x2013;y</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> are the same point, the line &quot;between&quot; <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> should extend to be the tangent to the curve at this point <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>. This tangent will intersect the curve at exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line. Curiously, these techniques work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In elliptic curve math, there is also a point called the &quot;point at infinity,&quot; which roughly corresponds to the role of the number zero in addition. On computers, it&#x2019;s sometimes represented by <em>x</em> = <em>y</em> = 0 (which doesn&#x2019;t satisfy the elliptic curve equation, but it&#x2019;s an easy separate case that can be checked). There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the point at infinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases (e.g., if <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> have the same <em>x</em> values but different <em>y</em> values), the line will be exactly vertical, in which case <em>P</em><sub>3</sub> = the point at infinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> is the point at infinity, then <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>. Similarly, if <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> is the point at infinity, then <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role that zero plays in &quot;normal&quot; arithmetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that + is associative, which means that (<em>A</em> + <em>B</em>) + <em>C</em> = <em>A</em> + (<em>B</em> + <em>C</em>). That means we can write <em>A</em> + <em>B</em> + <em>C</em> (without parentheses) without ambiguity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point <em>P</em> on the elliptic curve, if <em>k</em> is a whole number, then <em>k</em> * <em>P</em> = <em>P</em> + <em>P</em> + <em>P</em> + &#x2026;&#x200B; + <em>P</em> (<em>k</em> times). Note that <em>k</em> is sometimes (perhaps confusingly) called an &quot;exponent&quot; in this case.</p>

<h3 id="hash_functions">Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptographic hash functions are used throughout Ethereum. In fact, hash functions are used extensively in almost all cryptographic systems&#x2014;a fact captured by <span class="keep-together">cryptographer</span> <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q79qZp" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier</a>, who said, &quot;Much more than encryption algorithms, one-way hash functions are the workhorses of modern cryptography.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section we will discuss hash functions, explore their basic properties, and see how those properties make them so useful in so many areas of modern cryptography. We address hash functions here because they are part of the transformation of Ethereum public keys into addresses. They can also be used to create <em>digital fingerprints</em>, which aid in the verification of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In simple terms, a <a href="http://bit.ly/2CR26gD" target="_blank"><em>hash function</em></a> is &#x201C;any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.&#x201D; The input to a hash function is called a <em>pre-image</em>, the <em>message</em>, or simply the <em>input data</em>. The output is called the <em>hash</em>. <a href="http://bit.ly/2Jrn3jM" target="_blank"><em>Cryptographic hash functions</em></a> are a special subcategory that have specific properties that are useful to secure platforms, such as Ethereum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cryptographic hash function is a <em>one-way</em> hash function that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size string of bits. The &quot;one-way&quot; nature means that it is computationally infeasible to recreate the input data if one only knows the output hash. The only way to determine a possible input is to conduct a brute-force search, checking each candidate for a matching output; given that the search space is virtually infinite, it is easy to understand the practical impossibility of the task. Even if you find some input data that creates a matching hash, it may not be the original input data: hash functions are &quot;many-to-one&quot; functions. Finding two sets of input data that hash to the same output is called finding a <em>hash collision</em>. Roughly speaking, the better the hash function, the rarer hash collisions are. For Ethereum, they are effectively impossible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at the main properties of cryptographic hash functions. These include:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Determinism</dt>
<dd>
<p>A given input message always produces the same hash output.</p>

<dd>
<p>Computing the hash of a message is efficient (linear complexity).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Noncorrelation</dt>
<dd>
<p>A small change to the message (e.g., a 1-bit change) should change the hash output so extensively that it cannot be correlated to the hash of the original message.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Irreversibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>Computing the message from its hash is infeasible, equivalent to a brute-force search through all possible messages.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collision protection</dt>
<dd>
<p>It should be infeasible to calculate two different messages that produce the same hash output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resistance to hash collisions is particularly important for avoiding digital signature forgery in Ethereum.</p>

<h4 id="keccak256">Ethereum&#x2019;s Cryptographic Hash Function: Keccak-256</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethereum uses the <em>Keccak-256</em> cryptographic hash function in many places. Keccak-256 was designed as a candidate for the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Function Competition held in 2007 by the National Institute of Science and Technology. Keccak was the winning algorithm, which became standardized as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202 in 2015.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, during the period when Ethereum was developed, the NIST standardization was not yet finalized. NIST adjusted some of the parameters of Keccak after the completion of the standards process, allegedly to improve its efficiency. This was occurring at the same time as heroic whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed documents that imply that NIST may have been improperly influenced by the National Security Agency to intentionally weaken the Dual_EC_DRBG random-number generator standard, effectively placing a backdoor in the standard random number generator. The result of this controversy was a backlash against the proposed changes and a significant delay in the standardization of SHA-3. At the time, the Ethereum Foundation decided to implement the original Keccak algorithm, as proposed by its inventors, rather than the SHA-3 standard as modified by NIST.</p>

<p>An easy way to tell is to use a <em>test vector</em>, an expected output for a given input. The test most commonly used for a hash function is the <em>empty input</em>. If you run the hash function with an empty string as input you should see the following results:</p>

<p>Unlike Bitcoin addresses, which are encoded in the user interface of all clients to include a built-in checksum to protect against mistyped addresses, Ethereum addresses are presented as raw hexadecimal without any checksum.</p>

<p>In reality, these higher layers were developed too slowly and this design choice led to a number of problems in the early days of the ecosystem, including the loss of funds due to mistyped addresses and input validation errors. Furthermore, because Ethereum name services were developed slower than initially expected, alternative encodings were adopted very slowly by wallet developers. We&#x2019;ll look at a few of the encoding options next.</p>

<h4 id="ICAP">Inter Exchange Client Address Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Inter exchange Client Address Protocol</em> (ICAP) is an Ethereum address encoding that is partly compatible with the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) encoding, offering a versatile, checksummed, and interoperable encoding for Ethereum addresses. ICAP addresses can encode Ethereum addresses or common names registered with an Ethereum name registry. You can read more about ICAP on the <a href="http://bit.ly/2JsZHKu" target="_blank">Ethereum Wiki</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IBAN is an international standard for identifying bank account numbers, mostly used for wire transfers. It is broadly adopted in the European Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and beyond. IBAN is a centralized and heavily regulated service. ICAP is a decentralized but compatible implementation for Ethereum addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An IBAN consists of a string of up to 34 alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) comprising a country code, checksum, and bank account identifier (which is country-specific).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ICAP uses the same structure by introducing a nonstandard country code, &#x201C;XE,&#x201D; that stands for &quot;Ethereum,&#x201D; followed by a two-character checksum and three possible variations of an account identifier:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Direct</dt>
<dd>
<p>A big-endian base-36 integer comprised of up to 30 alphanumeric characters, representing the 155 least significant bits of an Ethereum address. Because this encoding fits less than the full 160 bits of a general Ethereum address, it only works for Ethereum addresses that start with one or more zero bytes. The advantage is that it is compatible with IBAN, in terms of the field length and checksum. Example: XE60HAMICDXSV5QXVJA7TJW47Q9CHWKJD (33 characters long).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Basic</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as the Direct encoding, except that it is 31 characters long. This allows it to encode any Ethereum address, but makes it incompatible with IBAN field validation. Example: XE18CHDJBPLTBCJ03FE9O2NS0BPOJVQCU2P (35 characters long).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Indirect</dt>
<dd>
<p>Encodes an identifier that resolves to an Ethereum address through a name registry provider. It uses 16 alphanumeric characters, comprising an <em>asset identifier</em> (e.g., ETH), a name service (e.g., XREG), and a 9-character human-readable name (e.g., KITTYCATS). Example: XE##ETHXREGKITTYCATS (20 characters long), where the ## should be replaced by the two computed checksum characters.</p>

<h4 id="EIP55">Hex Encoding with Checksum in Capitalization (EIP-55)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the slow deployment of ICAP and name services, a standard was proposed by <a href="https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md" target="_blank">Ethereum Improvement Proposal 55 (EIP-55)</a>. EIP-55 offers a backward-compatible checksum for Ethereum addresses by modifying the capitalization of the hexadecimal address. The idea is that Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive and all wallets are supposed to accept Ethereum addresses expressed in capital or lowercase characters, without any difference in interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By modifying the capitalization of the alphabetic characters in the address, we can convey a checksum that can be used to protect the integrity of the address against typing or reading mistakes. Wallets that do not support EIP-55 checksums simply ignore the fact that the address contains mixed capitalization, but those that do support it can validate it and detect errors with a 99.986% accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mixed-capitals encoding is subtle and you may not notice it at first. Our example address is:</p>

<p>Our address contains an alphabetic character d in the fourth position. The fourth character of the hash is 6, which is less than 8. So, we leave the d lowercase. The next alphabetic character in our address is f, in the sixth position. The sixth character of the hexadecimal hash is c, which is greater than 8. Therefore, we capitalize the F in the address, and so on. As you can see, we only use the first 20 bytes (40 hex characters) of the hash as a checksum, since we only have 20 bytes (40 hex characters) in the address to capitalize appropriately.</p>

<p>Check the resulting mixed-capitals address yourself and see if you can tell which characters were capitalized and which characters they correspond to in the address hash:</p>

<h5 id="EIP55_error">Detecting an error in an EIP-55 encoded address</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, let&#x2019;s look at how EIP-55 addresses will help us find an error. Let&#x2019;s assume we have printed out an Ethereum address, which is EIP-55 encoded:</p>

<pre>0x001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0F9</pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#x2019;s make a basic mistake in reading that address. The character before the last one is a capital F. For this example let&#x2019;s assume we misread that as a capital E, and we type the following (incorrect) address into our wallet:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, our wallet is EIP-55 compliant! It notices the mixed capitalization and attempts to validate the address. It converts it to lowercase, and calculates the checksum hash:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, even though the address has only changed by one character (in fact, only one bit, as e and f are one bit apart), the hash of the address has changed radically. That&#x2019;s the property of hash functions that makes them so useful for checksums!</p>
</div>

<p>Now, let&#x2019;s line up the two and check the capitalization:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#x2019;s all wrong! Several of the alphabetic characters are incorrectly capitalized. Remember that the capitalization is the encoding of the <em>correct</em> checksum.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The capitalization of the address we input doesn&#x2019;t match the checksum just calculated, meaning something has changed in the address, and an error has been <span class="keep-together">introduced</span>.</p>

<h3 id="keys-addresses-conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we provided a brief survey of public key cryptography and focused on the use of public and private keys in Ethereum and the use of cryptographic tools, such as hash functions, in the creation and verification of Ethereum addresses. We also looked at digital signatures and how they can demonstrate ownership of a private key without revealing that private key. In <a href="#wallets_chapter">[wallets_chapter]</a>, we will put these ideas together and look at how wallets can be used to manage collections of keys.</p>
