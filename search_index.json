Ethereum\n\n\n\nMastering Ethereum is a book for developers, offering a guide to the operation and use of the Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, RootStock (RSK) and other compatible EVM-based open blockchains.\nReading this book\nTo read this book, open book.asciidoc and click on each chapter.\nPDF Version\nThere is no PDF version available. While it is possible to produce one, and you may do so for personal use, please DO NOT publish a PDF. The publishers and the authors provide a very generous open license that allows anyone to read this book for free on GitHub. It is not convenient to read that way, but it is free. Convenience, in the form of a nicely packaged PDF, ebook or printed book, is what the publishers charge money for and what pays for the publishers and authors work. Just like buying bottled water instead of drinking from the tap, buying a printed copy, PDF or ebook pays for the packaging. If you publish a PDF copy, you are violating the license, as a PDF is a derivative form and the -ND part of the license means \"no derivatives\". Doing so makes publishers less likely to publish with open licenses.\nContent\nThe content status is \"COMPLETE\". The first edition of this book was published on December 1st, 2018. That edition is available in print and ebook format at many popular bookstores.

Antonopoulos and Dr. Gavin Wood. A series of fortunate coincidences brought these two authors together in an effort that galvanized hundreds of contributors to produce this book, in the best spirit of open source and the creative commons culture.\n\n\nGavin had been wishing to write a book that expanded on the Yellow Paper (his technical description of the Ethereum protocol) for some time, primarily to open it up to a wider audience than the original Greek-letter-infused document could possibly allow.\n\n\nPlans were underway—a publisher had been found—when Gavin got talking to Andreas, whom he had known from the very beginning of his tenure with Ethereum as a notable personality in the space.\n\n\nAndreas had recently published the first edition of his book Mastering Bitcoin (O’Reilly), which quickly became the authoritative technical guide to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Almost as soon as the book was published, his readers started asking him, \"When will you write 'Mastering Ethereum'?\" Andreas was already considering his next project and found Ethereum to be a compelling technical subject.\n\n\nFinally, in May 2016, Gavin and Andreas were both coincidentally in the same city at the same time. They met up for a coffee to chat about working on the book together. With both Andreas and Gavin being devotees of the open source paradigm, they both committed to making this a collaborative effort, released under a Creative Commons license. Thankfully, the publisher, O’Reilly Media, was happy to agree, and the Mastering Ethereum project was officially launched.\n\n\nHow to Use This Book\n\nThe book is intended to serve both as a reference manual and as a cover-to-cover exploration of Ethereum. The first two chapters offer a gentle introduction, suitable for novice users, and the examples in those chapters can be completed by anyone with a bit of technical skill. Those two chapters will give you a good grasp of the basics and allow you to use the fundamental tools of Ethereum. [ethereum_clients_chapter] and beyond are intended mainly for programmers and include many technical topics and programming examples.\n\n\nTo serve as both a reference manual and a cover-to-cover narrative about Ethereum, the book inevitably contains some duplication. Some topics, such as gas, have to be introduced early enough for the rest of the topics to make sense, but are also examined in depth in their own sections.\n\n\nFinally, the book’s index allows readers to find very specific topics and the relevant sections with ease, by keyword.\n\n\n\nIntended Audience\n\nThis book is mostly intended for coders. If you can use a programming language, this book will teach you how smart contract blockchains work, how to use them, and how to develop smart contracts and decentralized applications with them. The first few chapters are also suitable as an in-depth introduction to Ethereum for noncoders.\n\n\n\nConventions Used in This Book\n\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this book:\n\n\n\nItalic\n\nIndicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.\n\nConstant width\n\nUsed for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.\n\nConstant width bold\n\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user.\n\nConstant width italic\n\nShows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or values determined by context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis icon signifies a tip or suggestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis icon signifies a general note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis icon indicates a warning or caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Examples\n\nThe examples are illustrated in Solidity, Vyper, and JavaScript, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system. All code snippets are available in the GitHub repository under the code subdirectory. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook.\n\n\nAll the code snippets can be replicated on most operating systems with a minimal installation of compilers, interpreters, and libraries for the corresponding languages. Where necessary, we provide basic installation instructions and step-by-step examples of the output of those instructions.\n\n\nSome of the code snippets and code output have been reformatted for print. In all such cases, the lines have been split by a backslash (\\) character, followed by a newline character. When transcribing the examples, remove those two characters and join the lines again and you should see identical results to those shown in the example.\n\n\nAll the code snippets use real values and calculations where possible, so that you can build from example to example and see the same results in any code you write to calculate the same values. For example, the private keys and corresponding public keys and addresses are all real. The sample transactions, contracts, blocks, and blockchain references have all been introduced to the actual Ethereum blockchain and are part of the public ledger, so you can review them.\n\n\n\nUsing Code Examples\n\nThis book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require permission.

My mother also bought me my first computer in 1982, despite being a self-described technophobe. My father, Menelaos, a civil engineer who published his first book at 80 years old, was the one who taught me logical and analytical thinking and a love of science and engineering.\n\n\nThank you all for supporting me throughout this journey.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments by Gavin\n\nMy mother secured my first computer for me from a neighbor when I was 9 years old, without which my technical progress would no doubt have been lessened. I also owe her my childhood fear of electricity and must acknowledge Trevor and my grandparents, who performed the grave duty of \"watching me plug it in\" time after time, and without whom said computer would have been useless. I must also acknowledge the various educators I have been lucky to have through my life, from said neighbor Sean (who taught me my first computer program), to Mr. Quinn my primary school teacher, who fixed it for me to do more programming and less history, through to secondary-school teachers like Richard Furlong-Brown, who fixed it for me to do more programming and less rugby.\n\n\nI must thank the mother of my children, Jutta, for her continued support, and the many people in my life, friends new and old, that keep me, roughly speaking, sane. Finally, a huge dollop of thanks must go to Aeron Buchanan, without whom the last five years of my life could never possibly have unfolded in the way they did and without whose time, support, and guidance this book would not be in as good shape as it is.\n\n\n\nContributions\n\nMany contributors offered comments, corrections, and additions to the early-release draft on GitHub.\n\n\nContributions on GitHub were facilitated by two GitHub editors who volunteered to project manage, review, edit, merge, and approve pull requests and issues:\n\n\n\n\nLead GitHub editor: Francisco Javier Rojas Garcia (fjrojasgarcia)\n\n\nAssisting GitHub editor: William Binns (wbnns)\n\n\n\n\nMajor contributions were provided on the topics of DApps, ENS, the EVM, fork history, gas, oracles, smart contract security, and Vyper.

These terms are used throughout the book, so bookmark this for quick reference.\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nAn object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).\n\nAddress\n\nMost generally, this represents an EOA or contract that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) transactions on the blockchain. More specifically, it is the rightmost 160 bits of a Keccak hash of an ECDSA public key.\n\nAssert\n\nIn Solidity, assert(false) compiles to 0xfe, an invalid opcode, which uses up all remaining gas and reverts all changes. When an assert() statement fails, something very wrong and unexpected is happening, and you will need to fix your code. You should use assert() to avoid conditions that should never, ever occur.\n\nBig-endian\n\nA positional number representation where the most significant digit is first. The opposite of little-endian, where the least significant digit is first.\n\nBIPs\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposals.  A set of proposals that members of the Bitcoin community have submitted to improve Bitcoin. For example, BIP-21 is a proposal to improve the Bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme.\n\nBlock\n\nA collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised transactions, and a set of other block headers known as ommers. Blocks are added to the Ethereum network by miners.\n\nBlockchain\n\nIn Ethereum, a sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block. This varies from the Bitcoin protocol in that it does not have a block size limit; it instead uses varying gas limits.\n\nBytecode\n\nAn abstract instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed in numeric format.\n\nByzantium fork\n\nThe first of two hard forks for the Metropolis development stage. It included EIP-649: Metropolis Difficulty Bomb Delay and Block Reward Reduction, where the Ice Age (see below) was delayed by 1 year and the block reward was reduced from 5 to 3 ether.\n\nCompiling\n\nConverting code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity) into a lower-level language (e.g., EVM bytecode).\n\nConsensus\n\nWhen numerous nodes—usually most nodes on the network—all have the same blocks in their locally validated best blockchain. Not to be confused with consensus rules.\n\nConsensus rules\n\nThe block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes. Not to be confused with consensus.\n\nConstantinople fork\n\nThe second part of the Metropolis stage, originally planned for mid-2018. Expected to include a switch to a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, among other changes.\n\nContract account\n\nAn account containing code that executes whenever it receives a transaction from another account (EOA or contract).\n\nContract creation transaction\n\nA special transaction, with the \"zero address\" as the recipient, that is used to register a contract and record it on the Ethereum blockchain (see \"zero address\").\n\nDAO\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization. A company or other organization that operates without hierarchical management. Also may refer to a contract named \"The DAO\" launched on April 30, 2016, which was then hacked in June 2016; this ultimately motivated a hard fork (codenamed DAO) at block #1,192,000, which reversed the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.\n\nDApp\n\nDecentralized application. At a minimum, it is a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services. In addition, many DApps include decentralized storage and/or a message protocol and platform.\n\nDeed\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) standard introduced by the ERC721 proposal. Unlike ERC20 tokens, deeds prove ownership and are not interchangeable, though they are not recognized as legal documents in any jurisdiction—at least not currently (see also \"NFT\").\n\nDifficulty\n\nA network-wide setting that controls how much computation is required to produce a proof of work.\n\nDigital signature\n\nA short string of data a user produces for a document using a private key such that anyone with the corresponding public key, the signature, and the document can verify that (1) the document was \"signed\" by the owner of that particular private key, and (2) the document was not changed after it was signed.\n\nECDSA\n\nElliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. A cryptographic algorithm used by Ethereum to ensure that funds can only be spent by their owners.\n\nEIP\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal. A design document providing information to the Ethereum community, describing a proposed new feature or its processes or environment. For more information, see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs (see also \"ERC\").\n\nENS\n\nEthereum Name Service. For more information, see https://github.com/ethereum/ens/.\n\nEntropy\n\nIn the context of cryptography, lack of predictability or level of randomness. When generating secret information, such as private keys, algorithms usually rely on a source of high entropy to ensure the output is unpredictable.\n\nEOA\n\nExternally Owned Account. An account created by or for human users of the Ethereum network.\n\nERC\n\nEthereum Request for Comments. A label given to some EIPs that attempt to define a specific standard of Ethereum usage.\n\nEthash\n\nA proof-of-work algorithm for Ethereum 1.0. For more information, see https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash.\n\nEther\n\nThe native cryptocurrency used by the Ethereum ecosystem, which covers gas costs when executing smart contracts. Its symbol is Ξ, the Greek uppercase Xi character.\n\nEvent\n\nAllows the use of EVM logging facilities. DApps can listen for events and use them to trigger JavaScript callbacks in the user interface. For more information, see http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#events.\n\nEVM\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine. A stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode. In Ethereum, the execution model specifies how the system state is altered given a series of bytecode instructions and a small tuple of environmental data. This is specified through a formal model of a virtual state machine.\n\nEVM assembly language\n\nA human-readable form of EVM bytecode.\n\nFallback function\n\nA default function called in the absence of data or a declared function name.\n\nFaucet\n\nA service that dispenses funds in the form of free test ether that can be used on a testnet.\n\nFinney\n\nA denomination of ether. 1015 finney = 1 ether.\n\nFork\n\nA change in protocol causing the creation of an alternative chain, or a temporal divergence in two potential block paths during mining.\n\nFrontier\n\nThe initial test development stage of Ethereum, which lasted from July 2015 to March 2016.\n\nGanache\n\nA personal Ethereum blockchain that you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.\n\nGas\n\nA virtual fuel used in Ethereum to execute smart contracts. The EVM uses an accounting mechanism to measure the consumption of gas and limit the consumption of computing resources (see \"Turing complete\").\n\nGas limit\n\nThe maximum amount of gas a transaction or block may consume.\n\nGavin Wood\n\nA British programmer who is the cofounder and former CTO of Ethereum. In August 2014 he proposed Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.\n\nGenesis block\n\nThe first block in a blockchain, used to initialize a particular network and its cryptocurrency.\n\nGeth\n\nGo Ethereum. One of the most prominent implementations of the Ethereum protocol, written in Go.\n\nHard fork\n\nA permanent divergence in the blockchain; also known as a hard-forking change. One commonly occurs when nonupgraded nodes can’t validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules. Not to be confused with a fork, soft fork, software fork, or Git fork.\n\nHash\n\nA fixed-length fingerprint of variable-size input, produced by a hash function.\n\nHD wallet\n\nA wallet using the hierarchical deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP-32).\n\nHD wallet seed\n\nA value used to generate the master private key and master chain code for an HD wallet. The wallet seed can be represented by mnemonic words, making it easier for humans to copy, back up, and restore private keys.\n\nHomestead\n\nThe second development stage of Ethereum, launched in March 2016 at block #1,150,000.\n\nICAP\n\nInter-exchange Client Address Protocol. An Ethereum address encoding that is partly compatible with the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) encoding, offering a versatile, checksummed, and interoperable encoding for Ethereum addresses. ICAP addresses use a new IBAN pseudo-country code: XE, standing for \"eXtended Ethereum,\" as used in nonjurisdictional currencies (e.g., XBT, XRP, XCP).\n\nIce Age\n\nA hard fork of Ethereum at block #200,000 to introduce an exponential difficulty increase (aka Difficulty Bomb), motivating a transition to proof of stake.\n\nIDE\n\nIntegrated Development Environment. A user interface that typically combines a code editor, compiler, runtime, and debugger.\n\nImmutable deployed code problem\n\nOnce a contract’s (or library’s) code is deployed, it becomes immutable. Standard software development practices rely on being able to fix possible bugs and add new features, so this represents a challenge for smart contract development.\n\nInternal transaction (also \"message\")\n\nA transaction sent from a contract account to another contract account or an EOA.\n\nIPFS\n\nInterPlanetary File System. A protocol, network, and open source project designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed filesystem.\n\nKDF\n\nKey Derivation Function. Also known as a \"password stretching algorithm,\" it is used by keystore formats to protect against brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks on passphrase encryption, by repeatedly hashing the passphrase.\n\nKeccak-256\n\nCryptographic hash function used in Ethereum. Keccak-256 was standardized as SHA-3.\n\nKeystore file\n\nA JSON-encoded file that contains a single (randomly generated) private key, encrypted by a passphrase for extra security.\n\nLevelDB\n\nAn open source on-disk key–value store, implemented as a lightweight, single-purpose library, with bindings to many platforms.\n\nLibrary\n\nA special type of contract that has no payable functions, no fallback function, and no data storage. Therefore, it cannot receive or hold ether, or store data. A library serves as previously deployed code that other contracts can call for read-only computation.\n\nLightweight client\n\nAn Ethereum client that does not store a local copy of the blockchain, or validate blocks and transactions. It offers the functions of a wallet and can create and broadcast transactions.\n\nMerkle Patricia Tree\n\nA data structure used in Ethereum to efficiently store key–value pairs.\n\nMessage\n\nAn internal transaction that is never serialized and only sent within the EVM.\n\nMessage call\n\nThe act of passing a message from one account to another. If the destination account is associated with EVM code, then the VM will be started with the state of that object and the message acted\nupon.\n\nMEToken\n\nMastering Ethereum Token. An ERC20 token used for demonstration in this book.\n\nMetropolis\n\nThe third development stage of Ethereum, launched in October 2017.\n\nMiner\n\nA network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.\n\nMist\n\nThe first Ethereum-enabled browser, built by the Ethereum Foundation. It contains a browser-based wallet that was the first implementation of the ERC20 token standard (Fabian Vogelsteller, author of ERC20, was also the main developer of Mist). Mist was also the first wallet to introduce the camelCase checksum (EIP-55; see [EIP55]). Mist runs a full node and offers a full DApp browser with support for Swarm-based storage and ENS addresses.\n\nNetwork\n\nReferring to the Ethereum network, a peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every Ethereum node (network participant).\n\nNFT\n\nA non-fungible token (also known as a \"deed\"). This is a token standard introduced by the ERC721 proposal. NFTs can be tracked and traded, but each token is unique and distinct; they are not interchangeable like ERC20 tokens. NFTs can represent ownership of digital or physical assets.\n\nNode\n\nA software client that participates in the network.\n\nNonce\n\nIn cryptography, a value that can only be used once. There are two types of nonce used in Ethereum: an account nonce is a transaction counter in each account, which is used to prevent replay attacks; a proof-of-work nonce is the random value in a block that was used to satisfy the proof of work.\n\nOmmer\n\nA child block of an ancestor that is not itself an ancestor. When a miner finds a valid block, another miner may have published a competing block which is added to the tip of the blockchain. Unlike with Bitcoin, orphaned blocks in Ethereum can be included by newer blocks as ommers and receive a partial block reward.

PoS asks users to prove ownership of a certain amount of cryptocurrency (their \"stake\" in the network) in order to be able to participate in the validation of transactions.\n\nProof of work (PoW)\n\nA piece of data (the proof) that requires significant computation to find. In Ethereum, miners must find a numeric solution to the Ethash algorithm that meets a network-wide difficulty target.\n\nPublic key\n\nA number, derived via a one-way function from a private key, which can be shared publicly and used by anyone to verify a digital signature made with the corresponding private key.\n\nReceipt\n\nData returned by an Ethereum client to represent the result of a particular transaction, including a hash of the transaction, its block number, the amount of gas used, and, in case of deployment of a smart contract, the address of the contract.\n\nRe-entrancy attack\n\nAn attack that consists of an attacker contract calling a victim contract function in such a way that during execution the victim calls the attacker contract again, recursively. This can result, for example, in the theft of funds by skipping parts of the victim contract that update balances or count withdrawal amounts.\n\nReward\n\nAn amount of ether included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the proof-of-work solution.\n\nRLP\n\nRecursive Length Prefix. An encoding standard designed by the Ethereum developers to encode and serialize objects (data structures) of arbitrary complexity and length.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\nThe name used by the person or people who designed Bitcoin, created its original reference implementation, and were the first to solve the double-spend problem for digital currency. Their real identity remains unknown.\n\nSecret key (aka private key)\n\nThe secret number that allows Ethereum users to prove ownership of an account or contracts, by producing a digital signature (see “public key,” “address,” “ECDSA”).\n\nSerenity\n\nThe fourth and final development stage of Ethereum. Serenity does not yet have a planned release date.\n\nSerpent\n\nA procedural (imperative) smart contract programming language with syntax similar to Python.\n\nSHA\n\nSecure Hash Algorithm.

Let’s start with a computer science–focused description, and then try to decipher that with a more practical analysis of Ethereum’s capabilities and characteristics, while comparing it to Bitcoin and other decentralized information exchange platforms (or \"blockchains\" for short).\n\n\nFrom a computer science perspective, Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.\n\n\nFrom a more practical perspective, Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.\n\n\nThe Ethereum platform enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions. While providing high availability, auditability, transparency, and neutrality, it also reduces or eliminates censorship and reduces certain counterparty risks.\n\n\nCompared to Bitcoin\n\nMany people will come to Ethereum with some prior experience of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin. Ethereum shares many common elements with other open blockchains: a peer-to-peer network connecting participants, a Byzantine fault–tolerant consensus algorithm for synchronization of state updates (a proof-of-work blockchain), the use of cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and hashes, and a digital currency (ether).\n\n\nYet in many ways, both the purpose and construction of Ethereum are strikingly different from those of the open blockchains that preceded it, including Bitcoin.\n\n\nEthereum’s purpose is not primarily to be a digital currency payment network. While the digital currency ether is both integral to and necessary for the operation of Ethereum, ether is intended as a utility currency to pay for use of the Ethereum platform as the world computer.\n\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has a very limited scripting language, Ethereum is designed to be a general-purpose programmable blockchain that runs a virtual machine capable of executing code of arbitrary and unbounded complexity. Where Bitcoin’s Script language is, intentionally, constrained to simple true/false evaluation of spending conditions, Ethereum’s language is Turing complete, meaning that Ethereum can straightforwardly function as a general-purpose computer.\n\n\n\nComponents of a Blockchain\n\nThe components of an open, public blockchain are (usually):\n\n\n\n\nA peer-to-peer (P2P) network connecting participants and propagating transactions and blocks of verified transactions, based on a standardized \"gossip\" protocol\n\n\nMessages, in the form of transactions, representing state transitions\n\n\nA set of consensus rules, governing what constitutes a transaction and what makes for a valid state transition\n\n\nA state machine that processes transactions according to the consensus rules\n\n\nA chain of cryptographically secured blocks that acts as a journal of all the verified and accepted state transitions\n\n\nA consensus algorithm that decentralizes control over the blockchain, by forcing participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules\n\n\nA game-theoretically sound incentivization scheme (e.g., proof-of-work costs plus block rewards) to economically secure the state machine in an open environment\n\n\nOne or more open source software implementations of the above (\"clients\")\n\n\n\n\nAll or most of these components are usually combined in a single software client. For example, in Bitcoin, the reference implementation is developed by the Bitcoin Core open source project and implemented as the bitcoind client. In Ethereum, rather than a reference implementation there is a reference specification, a mathematical description of the system in the Yellow Paper (see Further Reading). There are a number of clients, which are built according to the reference specification.\n\n\nIn the past, we used the term \"blockchain\" to represent all of the components just listed, as a shorthand reference to the combination of technologies that encompass all of the characteristics described. Today, however, there are a huge variety of blockchains with different properties. We need qualifiers to help us understand the characteristics of the blockchain in question, such as open, public, global, decentralized, neutral, and censorship-resistant, to identify the important emergent characteristics of a \"blockchain\" system that these components allow.\n\n\nNot all blockchains are created equal. When someone tells you that something is a blockchain, you have not received an answer; rather, you need to start asking a lot of questions to clarify what they mean when they use the word \"blockchain.\" Start by asking for a description of the components in the preceding list, then ask whether this \"blockchain\" exhibits the characteristics of being open, public, etc.\n\n\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nAll great innovations solve real problems, and Ethereum is no exception. Ethereum was conceived at a time when people recognized the power of the Bitcoin model, and were trying to move beyond cryptocurrency applications. But developers faced a conundrum: they either needed to build on top of Bitcoin or start a new blockchain. Building upon Bitcoin meant living within the intentional constraints of the network and trying to find workarounds. The limited set of transaction types, data types, and sizes of data storage seemed to limit the sorts of applications that could run directly on Bitcoin; anything else needed additional off-chain layers, and that immediately negated many of the advantages of using a public blockchain. For projects that needed more freedom and flexibility while staying on-chain, a new blockchain was the only option. But that meant a lot of work: bootstrapping all the infrastructure elements, exhaustive testing, etc.\n\n\nToward the end of 2013, Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer and Bitcoin enthusiast, started thinking about further extending the capabilities of Bitcoin and Mastercoin (an overlay protocol that extended Bitcoin to offer rudimentary smart contracts). In October of that year, Vitalik proposed a more generalized approach to the Mastercoin team, one that allowed flexible and scriptable (but not Turing-complete) contracts to replace the specialized contract language of Mastercoin. While the Mastercoin team were impressed, this proposal was too radical a change to fit into their development roadmap.\n\n\nIn December 2013, Vitalik started sharing a whitepaper that outlined the idea behind Ethereum: a Turing-complete, general-purpose blockchain. A few dozen people saw this early draft and offered feedback, helping Vitalik evolve the proposal.\n\n\nBoth of the authors of this book received an early draft of the whitepaper and commented on it. Andreas M. Antonopoulos was intrigued by the idea and asked Vitalik many questions about the use of a separate blockchain to enforce consensus rules on smart contract execution and the implications of a Turing-complete language. Andreas continued to follow Ethereum’s progress with great interest but was in the early stages of writing his book Mastering Bitcoin, and did not participate directly in Ethereum until much later. Dr. Gavin Wood, however, was one of the first people to reach out to Vitalik and offer to help with his C++ programming skills. Gavin became Ethereum’s cofounder, codesigner, and CTO.\n\n\nAs Vitalik recounts in his \"Ethereum Prehistory\" post:\n\n\n\n\nThis was the time when the Ethereum protocol was entirely my own creation. From here on, however, new participants started to join the fold. By far the most prominent on the protocol side was Gavin Wood…​\n\n\nGavin can also be largely credited for the subtle change in vision from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building programmable money, with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets and transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing platform. This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology, and later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on the “Web 3” ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite of decentralized technologies, the other two being Whisper and Swarm.\n\n\n\n\nStarting in December 2013, Vitalik and Gavin refined and evolved the idea, together building the protocol layer that became Ethereum.\n\n\nEthereum’s founders were thinking about a blockchain without a specific purpose, that could support a broad variety of applications by being programmed. The idea was that by using a general-purpose blockchain like Ethereum, a developer could program their particular application without having to implement the underlying mechanisms of peer-to-peer networks, blockchains, consensus algorithms, etc. The Ethereum platform was designed to abstract these details and provide a deterministic and secure programming environment for decentralized blockchain applications.\n\n\nMuch like Satoshi, Vitalik and Gavin didn’t just invent a new technology; they combined new inventions with existing technologies in a novel way and delivered the prototype code to prove their ideas to the world.\n\n\nThe founders worked for years, building and refining the vision. And on July 30, 2015, the first Ethereum block was mined. The world’s computer started serving the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin’s article \"A Prehistory of Ethereum\" was published in September 2017 and provides a fascinating first-person view of Ethereum’s earliest moments.\n\n\nYou can read it at\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum’s Four Stages of Development\n\nEthereum’s development was planned over four distinct stages, with major changes occurring at each stage. A stage may include subreleases, known as \"hard forks,\" that change functionality in a way that is not backward compatible.\n\n\nThe four main development stages are codenamed Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity. The intermediate hard forks that have occurred (or are planned) to date are codenamed Ice Age, DAO, Tangerine Whistle, Spurious Dragon, Byzantium, and Constantinople. Both the development stages and the intermediate hard forks are shown on the following timeline, which is \"dated\" by  block number:\n\n\n\nBlock #0\n\nFrontier—The initial stage of Ethereum, lasting from July 30, 2015, to March 2016.\n\nBlock #200,000\n\nIce Age—A hard fork to introduce an exponential difficulty increase, to motivate a transition to PoS when ready.\n\nBlock #1,150,000\n\nHomestead—The second stage of Ethereum, launched in March 2016.\n\nBlock #1,192,000\n\nDAO—A hard fork that reimbursed victims of the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.\n\nBlock #2,463,000\n\nTangerine Whistle—A hard fork to change the gas calculation for certain I/O-heavy operations and to clear the accumulated state from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploited the low gas cost of those operations.\n\nBlock #2,675,000\n\nSpurious Dragon—A hard fork to address more DoS attack vectors, and another state clearing. Also, a replay attack protection mechanism.\n\nBlock #4,370,000\n\nMetropolis Byzantium—Metropolis is the third stage of Ethereum, current at the time of writing this book, launched in October 2017. Byzantium is the first of two hard forks planned for Metropolis.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Byzantium, there is one more hard fork planned for Metropolis: Constantinople. Metropolis will be followed by the final stage of Ethereum’s deployment, codenamed Serenity.\n\n\n\nEthereum: A General-Purpose Blockchain\n\nThe original blockchain, namely Bitcoin’s blockchain, tracks the state of units of bitcoin and their ownership. You can think of Bitcoin as a distributed consensus state machine, where transactions cause a global state transition, altering the ownership of coins. The state transitions are constrained by the rules of consensus, allowing all participants to (eventually) converge on a common (consensus) state of the system, after several blocks are mined.\n\n\nEthereum is also a distributed state machine. But instead of tracking only the state of currency ownership, Ethereum tracks the state transitions of a general-purpose data store, i.e., a store that can hold any data expressible as a key–value tuple. A key–value data store holds arbitrary values, each referenced by some key; for example, the value \"Mastering Ethereum\" referenced by the key \"Book Title\". In some ways, this serves the same purpose as the data storage model of Random Access Memory (RAM) used by most general-purpose computers. Ethereum has memory that stores both code and data, and it uses the Ethereum blockchain to track how this memory changes over time. Like a general-purpose stored-program computer, Ethereum can load code into its state machine and run that code, storing the resulting state changes in its blockchain. Two of the critical differences from most general-purpose computers are that Ethereum state changes are governed by the rules of consensus and the state is distributed globally. Ethereum answers the question: \"What if we could track any arbitrary state and program the state machine to create a world-wide computer operating under consensus?\"\n\n\n\nEthereum’s Components\n\nIn Ethereum, the components of a blockchain system described in Components of a Blockchain are, more specifically:\n\n\n\nP2P network\n\nEthereum runs on the Ethereum main network, which is addressable on TCP port 30303, and runs a protocol called ÐΞVp2p.\n\nConsensus rules\n\nEthereum’s consensus rules are defined in the reference specification, the Yellow Paper (see Further Reading).\n\nTransactions\n\nEthereum transactions are network messages that include (among other things) a sender, recipient, value, and data payload.\n\n\n\n\n\nState machine\n\nEthereum state transitions are processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode (machine-language instructions). EVM programs, called \"smart contracts,\" are written in high-level languages (e.g., Solidity) and compiled to bytecode for execution on the EVM.\n\nData structures\n\nEthereum’s state is stored locally on each node as a database (usually Google’s LevelDB), which contains the transactions and system state in a serialized hashed data structure called a Merkle Patricia Tree.\n\nConsensus algorithm\n\nEthereum uses Bitcoin’s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by PoW to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. However, there are plans to move to a PoS weighted voting system, codenamed Casper, in the near future.\n\nEconomic security\n\nEthereum currently uses a PoW algorithm called Ethash, but this will eventually be dropped with the move to PoS at some point in the future.\n\nClients\n\nEthereum has several interoperable implementations of the client software, the most prominent of which are Go-Ethereum (Geth) and Parity.\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe following references provide additional information on the technologies mentioned here:\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Yellow Paper:\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf\n\n\nThe Beige Paper, a rewrite of the Yellow Paper for a broader audience in less formal language:\nhttps://github.com/chronaeon/beigepaper\n\n\nÐΞVp2p network protocol:\nhttp://bit.ly/2quAlTE\n\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine list of resources:\nhttp://bit.ly/2PmtjiS\n\n\nLevelDB database (used most often to store the local copy of the blockchain):\nhttp://leveldb.org\n\n\nMerkle Patricia trees:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree\n\n\nEthash PoW algorithm:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash\n\n\nCasper PoS v1 Implementation Guide:\nhttp://bit.ly/2DyPr3l\n\n\nGo-Ethereum (Geth) client:\nhttps://geth.ethereum.org/\n\n\nParity Ethereum client:\nhttps://parity.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum and Turing Completeness\n\nAs soon as you start reading about Ethereum, you will immediately encounter the term \"Turing complete.\" Ethereum, they say, unlike Bitcoin, is Turing complete. What exactly does that mean?\n\n\nThe term refers to English mathematician Alan Turing, who is considered the father of computer science. In 1936 he created a mathematical model of a computer consisting of a state machine that manipulates symbols by reading and writing them on sequential memory (resembling an infinite-length paper tape). With this construct, Turing went on to provide a mathematical foundation to answer (in the negative) questions about universal computability, meaning whether all problems are solvable. He proved that there are classes of problems that are uncomputable. Specifically, he proved that the halting problem (whether it is possible, given an arbitrary program and its input, to determine whether the program will eventually stop running) is not solvable.\n\n\nAlan Turing further defined a system to be Turing complete if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. Such a system is called a Universal Turing machine (UTM).\n\n\nEthereum’s ability to execute a stored program, in a state machine called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, while reading and writing data to memory makes it a Turing-complete system and therefore a UTM. Ethereum can compute any algorithm that can be computed by any Turing machine, given the limitations of finite memory.\n\n\nEthereum’s groundbreaking innovation is to combine the general-purpose computing architecture of a stored-program computer with a decentralized blockchain, thereby creating a distributed single-state (singleton) world computer. Ethereum programs run \"everywhere,\" yet produce a common state that is secured by the rules of consensus.\n\n\nTuring Completeness as a \"Feature\"\n\nHearing that Ethereum is Turing complete, you might arrive at the conclusion that this is a feature that is somehow lacking in a system that is Turing incomplete. Rather, it is the opposite. Turing completeness is very easy to achieve; in fact, the simplest Turing-complete state machine known  has 4 states and uses 6 symbols, with a state definition that is only 22 instructions long. Indeed, sometimes systems are found to be \"accidentally Turing complete.\" A fun reference of such systems can be found at http://bit.ly/2Og1VgX.\n\n\nHowever, Turing completeness is very dangerous, particularly in open access systems like public blockchains, because of the halting problem we touched on earlier. For example, modern printers are Turing complete and can be given files to print that send them into a frozen state. The fact that Ethereum is Turing complete means that any program of any complexity can be computed by Ethereum. But that flexibility brings some thorny security and resource management problems. An unresponsive printer can be turned off and turned back on again. That is not possible with a public blockchain.\n\n\n\nImplications of Turing Completeness\n\nTuring proved that you cannot predict whether a program will terminate by simulating it on a computer. In simple terms, we cannot predict the path of a program without running it. Turing-complete systems can run in \"infinite loops,\" a term used (in oversimplification) to describe a program that does not terminate. It is trivial to create a program that runs a loop that never ends. But unintended never-ending loops can arise without warning, due to complex interactions between the starting conditions and the code. In Ethereum, this poses a challenge: every participating node (client) must validate every transaction, running any smart contracts it calls. But as Turing proved, Ethereum can’t predict if a smart contract will terminate, or how long it will run, without actually running it (possibly running forever). Whether by accident or on purpose, a smart contract can be created such that it runs forever when a node attempts to validate it. This is effectively a DoS attack. And of course, between a program that takes a millisecond to validate and one that runs forever are an infinite range of nasty, resource-hogging, memory-bloating, CPU-overheating programs that simply waste resources. In a world computer, a program that abuses resources gets to abuse the world’s resources. How does Ethereum constrain the resources used by a smart contract if it cannot predict resource use in advance?\n\n\nTo answer this challenge, Ethereum introduces a metering mechanism called gas. As the EVM executes a smart contract, it carefully accounts for every instruction (computation, data access, etc.). Each instruction has a predetermined cost in units of gas. When a transaction triggers the execution of a smart contract, it must include an amount of gas that sets the upper limit of what can be consumed running the smart contract. The EVM will terminate execution if the amount of gas consumed by computation exceeds the gas available in the transaction. Gas is the mechanism Ethereum uses to allow Turing-complete computation while limiting the resources that any program can consume.\n\n\nThe next question is, 'how does one get gas to pay for computation on the Ethereum world computer?' You won’t find gas on any exchanges. It can only be purchased as part of a transaction, and can only be bought with ether. Ether needs to be sent along with a transaction and it needs to be explicitly earmarked for the purchase of gas, along with an acceptable gas price. Just like at the pump, the price of gas is not fixed. Gas is purchased for the transaction, the computation is executed, and any unused gas is refunded back to the sender of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\nFrom General-Purpose Blockchains to Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n\nEthereum started as a way to make a general-purpose blockchain that could be programmed for a variety of uses. But very quickly, Ethereum’s vision expanded to become a platform for programming DApps. DApps represent a broader perspective than smart contracts. A DApp is, at the very least, a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services.\n\n\nA DApp is composed of at least:\n\n\n\n\nSmart contracts on a blockchain\n\n\nA web frontend user interface\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, many DApps include other decentralized components, such as:\n\n\n\n\nA decentralized (P2P) storage protocol and platform\n\n\nA decentralized (P2P) messaging protocol and platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may see DApps spelled as ÐApps. The Ð character is the Latin character called \"ETH,\" alluding to Ethereum. To display this character, use the Unicode codepoint 0xD0, or if necessary the HTML character entity eth (or decimal entity #208).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Third Age of the Internet\n\nIn 2004 the term \"Web 2.0\" came to prominence, describing an evolution of the web toward user-generated content, responsive interfaces, and interactivity. Web 2.0 is not a technical specification, but rather a term describing the new focus of web applications.\n\n\nThe concept of DApps is meant to take the World Wide Web to its next natural evolutionary stage, introducing decentralization with peer-to-peer protocols into every aspect of a web application. The term used to describe this evolution is web3, meaning the third \"version\" of the web. First proposed by Dr. Gavin Wood, web3 represents a new vision and focus for web applications: from centrally owned and managed applications, to applications built on decentralized protocols.\n\n\nIn later chapters we’ll explore the Ethereum web3.js JavaScript library, which bridges JavaScript applications that run in your browser with the Ethereum blockchain. The web3.js library also includes an interface to a P2P storage network called Swarm and a P2P messaging service called Whisper. With these three components included in a JavaScript library running in your web browser, developers have a full application development suite that allows them to build web3 DApps.\n\n\n\nEthereum’s Development Culture\n\nSo far we’ve talked about how Ethereum’s goals and technology differ from those of other blockchains that preceded it, like Bitcoin. Ethereum also has a very different development culture.\n\n\nIn Bitcoin, development is guided by conservative principles: all changes are carefully studied to ensure that none of the existing systems are disrupted. For the most part, changes are only implemented if they are backward compatible. Existing clients are allowed to opt-in, but will continue to operate if they decide not to upgrade.\n\n\nIn Ethereum, by comparison, the community’s development culture is focused on the future rather than the past. The (not entirely serious) mantra is \"move fast and break things.\" If a change is needed, it is implemented, even if that means invalidating prior assumptions, breaking compatibility, or forcing clients to update. Ethereum’s development culture is characterized by rapid innovation, rapid evolution, and a willingness to deploy forward-looking improvements, even if this is at the expense of some backward compatibility.\n\n\nWhat this means to you as a developer is that you must remain flexible and be prepared to rebuild your infrastructure as some of the underlying assumptions change. One of the big challenges facing developers in Ethereum is the inherent contradiction between deploying code to an immutable system and a development platform that is still evolving. You can’t simply \"upgrade\" your smart contracts. You must be prepared to deploy new ones, migrate users, apps, and funds, and start over.\n\n\nIronically, this also means that the goal of building systems with more autonomy and less centralized control is still not fully realized. Autonomy and decentralization require a bit more stability in the platform than you’re likely to get in Ethereum in the next few years. In order to \"evolve\" the platform, you have to be ready to scrap and restart your smart contracts, which means you have to retain a certain degree of control over them.\n\n\nBut, on the positive side, Ethereum is moving forward very fast. There’s little opportunity for \"bike-shedding,\" an expression that means holding up development by arguing over minor details such as how to build the bicycle shed at the back of a nuclear power station. If you start bike-shedding, you might suddenly discover that while you were distracted the rest of the development team changed the plan and ditched bicycles in favor of autonomous hovercraft.\n\n\nEventually, the development of the Ethereum platform will slow down and its interfaces will become fixed. But in the meantime, innovation is the driving principle. You’d better keep up, because no one will slow down for you.\n\n\n\nWhy Learn Ethereum?\n\nBlockchains have a very steep learning curve, as they combine multiple disciplines into one domain: programming, information security, cryptography, economics, distributed systems, peer-to-peer networks, etc. Ethereum makes this learning curve a lot less steep, so you can get started quickly. But just below the surface of a deceptively simple environment lies a lot more. As you learn and start looking deeper, there’s always another layer of complexity and wonder.\n\n\nEthereum is a great platform for learning about blockchains and it’s building a massive community of developers, faster than any other blockchain platform. More than any other, Ethereum is a developer’s blockchain, built by developers for developers. A developer familiar with JavaScript applications can drop into Ethereum and start producing working code very quickly. For the first few years of Ethereum’s life, it was common to see T-shirts announcing that you can create a token in just five lines of code. Of course, this is a double-edged sword. It’s easy to write code, but it’s very hard to write good and secure code.\n\n\n\nWhat This Book Will Teach You\n\nThis book dives into Ethereum and examines every component. You will start with a simple transaction, dissect how it works, build a simple contract, make it better, and follow its journey through the Ethereum system.\n\n\nYou will learn not only how to use Ethereum—how it works—but also why it is designed the way it is. You will be able to understand how each of the pieces works, and how they fit together and why.\n\n\n\n"},"02intro.html":{"url":"02intro.html","title":"Chapter 2: Ethereum Basics","keywords":"","body":"\nEthereum Basics\n\n\nIn this chapter we will start exploring Ethereum, learning how to use wallets, how to create transactions, and also how to run a basic smart contract.\n\n\nEther Currency Units\n\nEthereum’s currency unit is called ether, identified also as \"ETH\" or with the symbols Ξ (from the Greek letter \"Xi\" that looks like a stylized capital E) or, less often, ♦: for example, 1 ether, or 1 ETH, or Ξ1, or ♦1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse Unicode character U+039E for Ξ and U+2666 for ♦.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEther is subdivided into smaller units, down to the smallest unit possible, which is named wei. One ether is 1 quintillion wei (1 * 1018 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000). You may hear people refer to the currency \"Ethereum\" too, but this is a common beginner’s mistake. Ethereum is the system, ether is the currency.\n\n\nThe value of ether is always represented internally in Ethereum as an unsigned integer value denominated in wei. When you transact 1 ether, the transaction encodes 1000000000000000000 wei as the value.\n\n\nEther’s various denominations have both a scientific name using the International System of Units (SI) and a colloquial name that pays homage to many of the great minds of computing and cryptography.\n\n\nEther denominations and unit names shows the various units, their colloquial (common) names, and their SI names. In keeping with the internal representation of value, the table shows all denominations in wei (first row), with ether shown as 1018 wei in the 7th row.\n\n\nTable 1.

We will use the term \"wallet\" to mean a software application that helps you manage your Ethereum account. In short, an Ethereum wallet is your gateway to the Ethereum system. It holds your keys and can create and broadcast transactions on your behalf. Choosing an Ethereum wallet can be difficult because there are many different options with different features and designs. Some are more suitable for beginners and some are more suitable for experts. The Ethereum platform itself is still being improved, and the \"best\" wallets are often the ones that adapt to the changes that come with the platform upgrades.\n\n\nBut don’t worry! If you choose a wallet and don’t like how it works—or if you like it at first but later want to try something else—you can change wallets quite easily. All you have to do is make a transaction that sends your funds from the old wallet to the new wallet, or export your private keys and import them into the new one.\n\n\nWe’ve selected three different types of wallets to use as examples throughout the book: a mobile wallet, a desktop wallet, and a web-based wallet. We’ve chosen these three wallets because they represent a broad range of complexity and features. However, the selection of these wallets is not an endorsement of their quality or security. They are simply a good starting place for demonstrations and testing.\n\n\nRemember that for a wallet application to work, it must have access to your private keys, so it is vital that you only download and use wallet applications from sources you trust. Fortunately, in general, the more popular a wallet application is, the more trustworthy it is likely to be. Nevertheless, it is good practice to avoid \"putting all your eggs in one basket\" and have your Ethereum accounts spread across a couple of wallets.\n\n\nThe following are some good starter wallets:\n\n\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask is a browser extension wallet that runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave Browser). It is easy to use and convenient for testing, as it is able to connect to a variety of Ethereum nodes and test blockchains. MetaMask is a web-based wallet.\n\nJaxx\n\nJaxx is a multiplatform and multicurrency wallet that runs on a variety of operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is often a good choice for new users as it is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Jaxx is either a mobile or a desktop wallet, depending on where you install it.\n\nMyEtherWallet (MEW)\n\nMyEtherWallet is a web-based wallet that runs in any browser. It has multiple sophisticated features we will explore in many of our examples. MyEtherWallet is a web-based wallet.\n\nEmerald Wallet\n\nEmerald Wallet is designed to work with the Ethereum Classic blockchain, but is compatible with other Ethereum-based blockchains. It’s an open source desktop application and works under Windows, macOS, and Linux. Emerald Wallet can run a full node or connect to a public remote node, working in a \"light\" mode. It also has a companion tool to do all operations from the command line.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll start by installing MetaMask on a desktop—but first, we’ll briefly discuss controlling and managing keys.\n\n\n\nControl and Responsibility\n\nOpen blockchains like Ethereum are important because they operate as a decentralized system. That means lots of things, but one crucial aspect is that each user of Ethereum can—and should—control their own private keys, which are the things that control access to funds and smart contracts. We sometimes call the combination of access to funds and smart contracts an \"account\" or \"wallet.\" These terms can get quite complex in their functionality, so we will go into this in more detail later. As a fundamental principle, however, it is as easy as one private key equals one \"account.\" Some users choose to give up control over their private keys by using a third-party custodian, such as an online exchange. In this book, we will teach you how to take control and manage your own private keys.\n\n\nWith control comes a big responsibility. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your funds and contracts. No one can help you regain access—your funds will be locked forever. Here are a few tips to help you manage this responsibility:\n\n\n\n\nDo not improvise security. Use tried-and-tested standard approaches.\n\n\nThe more important the account (e.g., the higher the value of the funds controlled, or the more significant the smart contracts accessible), the higher security measures should be taken.\n\n\nThe highest security is gained from an air-gapped device, but this level is not required for every account.\n\n\nNever store your private key in plain form, especially digitally. Fortunately, most user interfaces today won’t even let you see the raw private key.\n\n\nPrivate keys can be stored in an encrypted form, as a digital \"keystore\" file. Being encrypted, they need a password to unlock. When you are prompted to choose a password, make it strong (i.e., long and random), back it up, and don’t share it. If you don’t have a password manager, write it down and store it in a safe and secret place. To access your account, you need both the keystore file and the password.\n\n\nDo not store any passwords in digital documents, digital photos, screenshots, online drives, encrypted PDFs, etc. Again, do not improvise security. Use a password manager or pen and paper.\n\n\nWhen you are prompted to back up a key as a mnemonic word sequence, use pen and paper to make a physical backup. Do not leave that task \"for later\"; you will forget. These backups can be used to rebuild your private key in case you lose all the data saved on your system, or if you forget or lose your password. However, they can also be used by attackers to get your private keys, so never store them digitally, and keep the physical copy stored securely in a locked drawer or safe.\n\n\nBefore transferring any large amounts (especially to new addresses), first do a small test transaction (e.g., less than $1 value) and wait for confirmation of receipt.\n\n\nWhen you create a new account, start by sending only a small test transaction to the new address. Once you receive the test transaction, try sending back again from that account. There are lots of reasons account creation can go wrong, and if it has gone wrong, it is better to find out with a small loss. If the tests work, all is well.\n\n\nPublic block explorers are an easy way to independently see whether a transaction has been accepted by the network. However, this convenience has a negative impact on your privacy, because you reveal your addresses to block explorers, which can track you.\n\n\nDo not send money to any of the addresses shown in this book. The private keys are listed in the book and someone will immediately take that money.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve covered some basic best practices for key management and security, let’s get to work using MetaMask!\n\n\n\nGetting Started with MetaMask\n\nOpen the Google Chrome browser and navigate to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions.\n\n\nSearch for \"MetaMask\" and click on the logo of a fox. You should see something like the result shown in The detail page of the MetaMask Chrome extension.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The detail page of the MetaMask Chrome extension\n\n\nIt’s important to verify that you are downloading the real MetaMask extension, as sometimes people are able to sneak malicious extensions past Google’s filters. The real one:\n\n\n\n\nShows the ID nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn in the address bar\n\n\nIs offered by https://metamask.io\n\n\nHas more than 1,400 reviews\n\n\nHas more than 1,000,000 users\n\n\n\n\nOnce you confirm you are looking at the correct extension, click \"Add to Chrome\" to install it.\n\n\nCreating a Wallet\n\nOnce MetaMask is installed you should see a new icon (the head of a fox) in your browser’s toolbar. Click on it to get started. You will be asked to accept the terms and conditions and then to create your new Ethereum wallet by entering a password (see The password page of the MetaMask Chrome extension).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The password page of the MetaMask Chrome extension\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe password controls access to MetaMask, so that it can’t be used by anyone with access to your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve set a password, MetaMask will generate a wallet for you and show you a mnemonic backup consisting of 12 English words (see The mnemonic backup of your wallet, created by MetaMask). These words can be used in any compatible wallet to recover access to your funds should something happen to MetaMask or your computer. You do not need the password for this recovery; the 12 words are sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBack up your mnemonic (12 words) on paper, twice. Store the two paper backups in two separate secure locations, such as a fire-resistant safe, a locked drawer, or a safe deposit box. Treat the paper backups like cash of equivalent value to what you store in your Ethereum wallet. Anyone with access to these words can gain access and steal your money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The mnemonic backup of your wallet, created by MetaMask\n\n\nOnce you have confirmed that you have stored the mnemonic securely, you’ll be able to see the details of your Ethereum account, as shown in Your Ethereum account in MetaMask.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Your Ethereum account in MetaMask\n\n\nYour account page shows the name of your account (\"Account 1\" by default), an Ethereum address (0x9E713... in the example), and a colorful icon to help you visually distinguish this account from other accounts. At the top of the account page, you can see which Ethereum network you are currently working on (\"Main Network\" in the example).\n\n\nCongratulations! You have set up your first Ethereum wallet.\n\n\n\nSwitching Networks\n\nAs you can see on the MetaMask account page, you can choose between multiple Ethereum networks. By default, MetaMask will try to connect to the main network. The other choices are public testnets, any Ethereum node of your choice, or nodes running private blockchains on your own computer (localhost):\n\n\n\nMain Ethereum Network\n\nThe main public Ethereum blockchain. Real ETH, real value, and real consequences.\n\nRopsten Test Network\n\nEthereum public test blockchain and network. ETH on this network has no value.\n\nKovan Test Network\n\nEthereum public test blockchain and network using the Aura consensus protocol with proof of authority (federated signing). ETH on this network has no value. The Kovan test network is supported by Parity only. Other Ethereum clients use the Clique consensus protocol, which was proposed later, for proof of authority–based verification.\n\nRinkeby Test Network\n\nEthereum public test blockchain and network, using the Clique consensus protocol with proof of authority (federated signing). ETH on this network has no value.\n\nLocalhost 8545\n\nConnects to a node running on the same computer as the browser. The node can be part of any public blockchain (main or testnet), or a private testnet.\n\nCustom RPC\n\nAllows you to connect MetaMask to any node with a Geth-compatible Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface. The node can be part of any public or private blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYour MetaMask wallet uses the same private key and Ethereum address on all the networks it connects to. However, your Ethereum address balance on each Ethereum network will be different. Your keys may control ether and contracts on Ropsten, for example, but not on the main network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Some Test Ether\n\nYour first task is to get your wallet funded. You won’t be doing that on the main network because real ether costs money and handling it requires a bit more experience. For now, you’ll load your wallet with some testnet ether.\n\n\nSwitch MetaMask to the Ropsten Test Network. Click Buy, then click Ropsten Test Faucet. MetaMask will open a new web page, as shown in MetaMask Ropsten Test Faucet.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. MetaMask Ropsten Test Faucet\n\n\nYou may notice that the web page already contains your MetaMask wallet’s Ethereum address. MetaMask integrates Ethereum-enabled web pages with your MetaMask wallet and can \"see\" Ethereum addresses on the web page, allowing you, for example, to send a payment to an online shop displaying an Ethereum address. MetaMask can also populate the web page with your own wallet’s address as a recipient address if the web page requests it. In this page, the faucet application is asking MetaMask for a wallet address to send test ether to.\n\n\nClick the green \"request 1 ether from faucet\" button. You will see a transaction ID appear in the lower part of the page. The faucet app has created a transaction—a payment to you. The transaction ID looks like this:\n\n\n\n0x7c7ad5aaea6474adccf6f5c5d6abed11b70a350fbc6f9590109e099568090c57\n\n\n\nIn a few seconds, the new transaction will be mined by the Ropsten miners and your MetaMask wallet will show a balance of 1 ETH. Click on the transaction ID and your browser will take you to a block explorer, which is a website that allows you to visualize and explore blocks, addresses, and transactions. MetaMask uses the Etherscan block explorer, one of the more popular Ethereum block explorers. The transaction containing the payment from the Ropsten Test Faucet is shown in Etherscan Ropsten block explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Etherscan Ropsten block explorer\n\n\nThe transaction has been recorded on the Ropsten blockchain and can be viewed at any time by anyone, simply by searching for the transaction ID, or visiting the link.\n\n\nTry visiting that link, or entering the transaction hash into the ropsten.etherscan.io website, to see it for yourself.\n\n\n\nSending Ether from MetaMask\n\nOnce you’ve received your first test ether from the Ropsten Test Faucet, you can experiment with sending ether by trying to send some back to the faucet. As you can see on the Ropsten Test Faucet page, there is an option to \"donate\" 1 ETH to the faucet. This option is available so that once you’re done testing, you can return the remainder of your test ether, so that someone else can use it next. Even though test ether has no value, some people hoard it, making it difficult for everyone else to use the test networks. Hoarding test ether is frowned upon!\n\n\nFortunately, we are not test ether hoarders. Click the orange \"1 ether\" button to tell MetaMask to create a transaction paying the faucet 1 ether. MetaMask will prepare a transaction and pop up a window with the confirmation, as shown in Sending 1 ether to the faucet.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Sending 1 ether to the faucet\n\n\nOops! You probably noticed you can’t complete the transaction—MetaMask says you have an insufficient balance. At first glance this may seem confusing: you have 1 ETH, you want to send 1 ETH, so why is MetaMask saying you have insufficient funds?\n\n\nThe answer is because of the cost of gas. Every Ethereum transaction requires payment of a fee, which is collected by the miners to validate the transaction. The fees in Ethereum are charged in a virtual currency called gas. You pay for the gas with ether, as part of the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFees are required on the test networks too. Without fees, a test network would behave differently from the main network, making it an inadequate testing platform. Fees also protect the test networks from DoS attacks and poorly constructed contracts (e.g., infinite loops), much like they protect the main network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you sent the transaction, MetaMask calculated the average gas price of recent successful transactions at 3 gwei, which stands for gigawei. Wei is the smallest subdivision of the ether currency, as we discussed in Ether Currency Units. The gas limit is set at the cost of sending a basic transaction, which is 21,000 gas units. Therefore, the maximum amount of ETH you will spend is 3 * 21,000 gwei = 63,000 gwei = 0.000063 ETH. (Be advised that average gas prices can fluctuate, as they are predominantly determined by miners. We will see in a later chapter how you can increase/decrease your gas limit to ensure your transaction takes precedence if need be.)\n\n\nAll this to say: making a 1 ETH transaction costs 1.000063 ETH. MetaMask confusingly rounds that down to 1 ETH when showing the total, but the actual amount you need is 1.000063 ETH and you only have 1 ETH. Click Reject to cancel this transaction.\n\n\nLet’s get some more test ether! Click the green \"request 1 ether from the faucet\" button again and wait a few seconds. Don’t worry, the faucet should have plenty of ether and will give you more if you ask.\n\n\nOnce you have a balance of 2 ETH, you can try again. This time, when you click the orange \"1 ether\" donation button, you have sufficient balance to complete the transaction. Click Submit when MetaMask pops up the payment window. After all of this, you should see a balance of 0.999937 ETH because you sent 1 ETH to the faucet with 0.000063 ETH in gas.\n\n\n\nExploring the Transaction History of an Address\n\nBy now you have become an expert in using MetaMask to send and receive test ether. Your wallet has received at least two payments and sent at least one. You can view all these transactions using the ropsten.etherscan.io block explorer. You can either copy your wallet address and paste it into the block explorer’s search box, or have MetaMask open the page for you. Next to your account icon in MetaMask, you will see a button showing three dots. Click on it to show a menu of account-related options (see MetaMask account context menu).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. MetaMask account context menu\n\n\nSelect \"View account on Etherscan\" to open a web page in the block explorer showing your account’s transaction history, as shown in Address transaction history on Etherscan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Address transaction history on Etherscan\n\n\nHere you can see the entire transaction history of your Ethereum address. It shows all the transactions recorded on the Ropsten blockchain where your address is the sender or recipient. Click on a few of these transactions to see more details.\n\n\nYou can explore the transaction history of any address. Take a look at the transaction history of the Ropsten Test Faucet address (hint: it is the \"sender\" address listed in the oldest payment to your address). You can see all the test ether sent from the faucet to you and to other addresses. Every transaction you see can lead you to more addresses and more transactions. Before long you will be lost in the maze of interconnected data. Public blockchains contain an enormous wealth of information, all of which can be explored programmatically, as we will see in future examples.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the World Computer\n\nYou’ve now created a wallet and sent and received ether. So far, we’ve treated Ethereum as a cryptocurrency. But Ethereum is much, much more. In fact, the cryptocurrency function is subservient to Ethereum’s function as a decentralized world computer. Ether is meant to be used to pay for running smart contracts, which are computer programs that run on an emulated computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\n\nThe EVM is a global singleton, meaning that it operates as if it were a global, single-instance computer, running everywhere. Each node on the Ethereum network runs a local copy of the EVM to validate contract execution, while the Ethereum blockchain records the changing state of this world computer as it processes transactions and smart contracts. We’ll discuss this in much greater detail in [evm_chapter].\n\n\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contracts\n\nThe type of account you created in the MetaMask wallet is called an externally owned account (EOA). Externally owned accounts are those that have a private key; having the private key means control over access to funds or contracts. Now, you’re probably guessing there is another type of account. That other type of account is a contract account. A contract account has smart contract code, which a simple EOA can’t have. Furthermore, a contract account does not have a private key. Instead, it is owned (and controlled) by the logic of its smart contract code: the software program recorded on the Ethereum blockchain at the contract account’s creation and executed by the EVM.\n\n\nContracts have addresses, just like EOAs. Contracts can also send and receive ether, just like EOAs. However, when a transaction destination is a contract address, it causes that contract to run in the EVM, using the transaction, and the transaction’s data, as its input. In addition to ether, transactions can contain data indicating which specific function in the contract to run and what parameters to pass to that function. In this way, transactions can call functions within contracts.\n\n\nNote that because a contract account does not have a private key, it cannot initiate a transaction. Only EOAs can initiate transactions, but contracts can react to transactions by calling other contracts, building complex execution paths. One typical use of this is an EOA sending a request transaction to a multisignature smart contract wallet to send some ETH on to another address. A typical DApp programming pattern is to have Contract A calling Contract B in order to maintain a shared state across users of Contract A.\n\n\nIn the next few sections, we will write our first contract. You will then learn how to create, fund, and use that contract with your MetaMask wallet and test ether on the Ropsten test network.\n\n\n\nA Simple Contract: A Test Ether Faucet\n\nEthereum has many different high-level languages, all of which can be used to write a contract and produce EVM bytecode. You can read about many of the most prominent and interesting ones in [high_level_languages]. One high-level language is by far the dominant choice for smart contract programming: Solidity. Solidity was created by Dr. Gavin Wood, the coauthor of this book, and has become the most widely used language in Ethereum (and beyond). We’ll use Solidity to write our first contract.\n\n\nFor our first example (Faucet.sol: A Solidity contract implementing a faucet), we will write a contract that controls a faucet. You’ve already used a faucet to get test ether on the Ropsten test network. A faucet is a relatively simple thing: it gives out ether to any address that asks, and can be refilled periodically. You can implement a faucet as a wallet controlled by a human or a web server.\n\n\nExample 1. Faucet.sol: A Solidity contract implementing a faucet\n\n\n\nlink:code/Solidity/Faucet.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will find all the code samples for this book in the code subdirectory of the book’s GitHub repository. Specifically, our Faucet.sol contract is in:\n\n\n\ncode/Solidity/Faucet.sol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very simple contract, about as simple as we can make it. It is also a flawed contract, demonstrating a number of bad practices and security vulnerabilities. We will learn by examining all of its flaws in later sections. But for now, let’s look at what this contract does and how it works, line by line. You will quickly notice that many elements of Solidity are similar to existing programming languages, such as JavaScript, Java, or C++.\n\n\nThe first line is a comment:\n\n\n\n// Our first contract is a faucet!\n\n\n\nComments are for humans to read and are not included in the executable EVM bytecode. We usually put them on the line before the code we are trying to explain, or sometimes on the same line. Comments start with two forward slashes: //. Everything from the first slash until the end of that line is treated the same as a blank line and ignored.\n\n\nThe next line is where our actual contract starts:\n\n\n\ncontract Faucet {\n\n\n\nThis line declares a contract object, similar to a class declaration in other object-oriented languages. The contract definition includes all the lines between the curly braces ({}), which define a scope, much like how curly braces are used in many other programming languages.\n\n\nNext, we declare the first function of the Faucet contract:\n\n\n\nfunction withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n\n\n\nThe function is named withdraw, and it takes one unsigned integer (uint) argument named withdraw_amount. It is declared as a public function, meaning it can be called by other contracts. The function definition follows, between curly braces. The first part of the withdraw function sets a limit on withdrawals:\n\n\n\nrequire(withdraw_amount \n\n\n\nIt uses the built-in Solidity function require to test a precondition, that the withdraw_amount is less than or equal to 100,000,000,000,000,000 wei, which is the base unit of ether (see Ether denominations and unit names) and equivalent to 0.1 ether. If the withdraw function is called with a withdraw_amount greater than that amount, the require function here will cause contract execution to stop and fail with an exception. Note that statements need to be terminated with a semicolon in Solidity.\n\n\nThis part of the contract is the main logic of our faucet. It controls the flow of funds out of the contract by placing a limit on withdrawals. It’s a very simple control but can give you a glimpse of the power of a programmable blockchain: decentralized software controlling money.\n\n\nNext comes the actual withdrawal:\n\n\n\nmsg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n\n\n\nA couple of interesting things are happening here. The msg object is one of the inputs that all contracts can access. It represents the transaction that triggered the execution of this contract. The attribute sender is the sender address of the transaction. The function transfer is a built-in function that transfers ether from the current contract to the address of the sender. Reading it backward, this means transfer to the sender of the msg that triggered this contract execution. The transfer function takes an amount as its only argument. We pass the withdraw_amount value that was the parameter to the withdraw function declared a few lines earlier.\n\n\nThe very next line is the closing curly brace, indicating the end of the definition of our withdraw function.\n\n\nNext, we we declare one more function:\n\n\n\nfunction () public payable {}\n\n\n\nThis function is a so-called fallback or default function, which is called if the transaction that triggered the contract didn’t name any of the declared functions in the contract, or any function at all, or didn’t contain data. Contracts can have one such default function (without a name) and it is usually the one that receives ether. That’s why it is defined as a public and payable function, which means it can accept ether into the contract. It doesn’t do anything, other than accept the ether, as indicated by the empty definition in the curly braces ({}). If we make a transaction that sends ether to the contract address, as if it were a wallet, this function will handle it.\n\n\nRight below our default function is the final closing curly brace, which closes the definition of the contract Faucet. That’s it!\n\n\n\nCompiling the Faucet Contract\n\nNow that we have our first example contract, we need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the Solidity code into EVM bytecode so it can be executed by the EVM on the blockchain itself.\n\n\nThe Solidity compiler comes as a standalone executable, as part of various frameworks, and bundled in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). To keep things simple, we will use one of the more popular IDEs, called Remix.\n\n\nUse your Chrome browser (with the MetaMask wallet you installed earlier) to navigate to the Remix IDE at https://remix.ethereum.org.\n\n\nWhen you first load Remix, it will start with a sample contract called ballot.sol. We don’t need that, so close it by clicking the x on the corner of the tab, as seen in Close the default example tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Close the default example tab\n\n\nNow, add a new tab by clicking on the circular plus sign in the top-left toolbar, as seen in Click the plus sign to open a new tab. Name the new file Faucet.sol.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Click the plus sign to open a new tab\n\n\nOnce you have the new tab open, copy and paste the code from our example Faucet.sol, as seen in Copy the Faucet example code into the new tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Copy the Faucet example code into the new tab\n\n\nOnce you have loaded the Faucet.sol contract into the Remix IDE, the IDE will automatically compile the code. If all goes well, you will see a green box with \"Faucet\" in it appear on the right, under the Compile tab, confirming the successful compilation (see Remix successfully compiles the Faucet.sol contract).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Remix successfully compiles the Faucet.sol contract\n\n\nIf something goes wrong, the most likely problem is that the Remix IDE is using a version of the Solidity compiler that is different from 0.4.19. In that case, our pragma directive will prevent Faucet.sol from compiling. To change the compiler version, go to the Settings tab, set the version to 0.4.19, and try again.\n\n\nThe Solidity compiler has now compiled our Faucet.sol into EVM bytecode. If you are curious, the bytecode looks like this:\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE ISZERO PUSH2 0xF JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1\nREVERT JUMPDEST PUSH1 0xE5 DUP1 PUSH2 0x1D PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0x0 RETURN\nSTOP PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x4 CALLDATASIZE LT PUSH1 0x3F JUMPI\nPUSH1 0x0 CALLDATALOAD PUSH29\n0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nSWAP1 DIV PUSH4 0xFFFFFFFF AND DUP1 PUSH4 0x2E1A7D4D EQ PUSH1 0x41 JUMPI\nJUMPDEST STOP JUMPDEST CALLVALUE ISZERO PUSH1 0x4B JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT\nJUMPDEST PUSH1 0x5F PUSH1 0x4 DUP1 DUP1 CALLDATALOAD SWAP1 PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP1\nSWAP2 SWAP1 POP POP PUSH1 0x61 JUMP JUMPDEST STOP JUMPDEST PUSH8\n0x16345785D8A0000 DUP2 GT ISZERO ISZERO ISZERO PUSH1 0x77 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1\nREVERT JUMPDEST CALLER PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND\nPUSH2 0x8FC DUP3 SWAP1 DUP2 ISZERO MUL SWAP1 PUSH1 0x40 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1\n0x40 MLOAD DUP1 DUP4 SUB DUP2 DUP6 DUP9 DUP9 CALL SWAP4 POP POP POP POP ISZERO\nISZERO PUSH1 0xB6 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP JUMP STOP LOG1 PUSH6\n0x627A7A723058 KECCAK256 PUSH9 0x13D1EA839A4438EF75 GASLIMIT CALLVALUE LOG4 0x5f\nPUSH24 0x7541F409787592C988A079407FB28B4AD000290000000000\n\n\n\nAren’t you glad you are using a high-level language like Solidity instead of programming directly in EVM bytecode? Me too!\n\n\n\nCreating the Contract on the Blockchain\n\nSo, we have a contract. We’ve compiled it into bytecode. Now, we need to \"register\" the contract on the Ethereum blockchain. We will be using the Ropsten testnet to test our contract, so that’s the blockchain we want to submit it to.\n\n\nRegistering a contract on the blockchain involves creating a special transaction whose destination is the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, also known as the zero address. The zero address is a special address that tells the Ethereum blockchain that you want to register a contract. Fortunately, the Remix IDE will handle all of that for you and send the transaction to MetaMask.\n\n\nFirst, switch to the Run tab and select Injected Web3 in the Environment drop-down selection box. This connects the Remix IDE to the MetaMask wallet, and through MetaMask to the Ropsten test network. Once you do that, you can see Ropsten under Environment. Also, in the Account selection box it shows the address of your wallet (see Remix IDE Run tab, with Injected Web3 environment selected).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Remix IDE Run tab, with Injected Web3 environment selected\n\n\nRight below the Run settings you just confirmed is the Faucet contract, ready to be created. Click on the Deploy button shown in Remix IDE Run tab, with Injected Web3 environment selected.\n\n\nRemix will construct the special \"creation\" transaction and MetaMask will ask you to approve it, as shown in MetaMask showing the contract creation transaction. You’ll notice the contract creation transaction has no ether in it, but it has 258 bytes of data (the compiled contract) and will consume 10 gwei in gas. Click Submit to approve it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15. MetaMask showing the contract creation transaction\n\n\nNow you have to wait. It will take about 15 to 30 seconds for the contract to be mined on Ropsten. Remix won’t appear to be doing much, but be patient.\n\n\nOnce the contract is created, it appears at the bottom of the Run tab (see The Faucet contract is ALIVE!).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16. The Faucet contract is ALIVE!\n\n\nNotice that the Faucet contract now has an address of its own: Remix shows it as “Faucet at 0x72e…​c7829” (although your address, the random letters and numbers, will be different). The small clipboard symbol to the right allows you to copy the contract address to your clipboard. We will use that in the next section.\n\n\n\nInteracting with the Contract\n\nLet’s recap what we’ve learned so far: Ethereum contracts are programs that control money, which run inside a virtual machine called the EVM. They are created by a special transaction that submits their bytecode to be recorded on the blockchain. Once they are created on the blockchain, they have an Ethereum address, just like wallets. Anytime someone sends a transaction to a contract address it causes the contract to run in the EVM, with the transaction as its input. Transactions sent to contract addresses may have ether or data or both. If they contain ether, it is \"deposited\" to the contract balance. If they contain data, the data can specify a named function in the contract and call it, passing arguments to the function.\n\n\nViewing the Contract Address in a Block Explorer\n\nWe now have a contract recorded on the blockchain, and we can see it has an Ethereum address. Let’s check it out in the ropsten.etherscan.io block explorer and see what a contract looks like. In the Remix IDE, copy the address of the contract by clicking the clipboard icon next to its name (see Copy the contract address from Remix).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17. Copy the contract address from Remix\n\n\nKeep Remix open; we’ll come back to it again later. Now, navigate your browser to ropsten.etherscan.io and paste the address into the search box. You should see the contract’s Ethereum address history, as shown in View the Faucet contract address in the Etherscan block explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18. View the Faucet contract address in the Etherscan block explorer\n\n\n\nFunding the Contract\n\nFor now, the contract only has one transaction in its history: the contract creation transaction. As you can see, the contract also has no ether (zero balance). That’s because we didn’t send any ether to the contract in the creation transaction, even though we could have.\n\n\nOur faucet needs funds! Our first project will be to use MetaMask to send ether to the contract. You should still have the address of the contract in your clipboard (if not, copy it again from Remix). Open MetaMask, and send 1 ether to it, exactly as you would to any other Ethereum address (see Send 1 ether to the contract address).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19. Send 1 ether to the contract address\n\n\nIn a minute, if you reload the Etherscan block explorer, it will show another transaction to the contract address and an updated balance of 1 ether.\n\n\nRemember the unnamed default public payable function in our Faucet.sol code? It looked like this:\n\n\n\nfunction () public payable {}\n\n\n\nWhen you sent a transaction to the contract address, with no data specifying which function to call, it called this default function. Because we declared it as payable, it accepted and deposited the 1 ether into the contract’s account balance. Your transaction caused the contract to run in the EVM, updating its balance. You have funded your faucet!\n\n\n\nWithdrawing from Our Contract\n\nNext, let’s withdraw some funds from the faucet. To withdraw, we have to construct a transaction that calls the withdraw function and passes a withdraw_amount argument to it. To keep things simple for now, Remix will construct that transaction for us and MetaMask will present it for our approval.\n\n\nReturn to the Remix tab and look at the contract on the Run tab. You should see a red box labeled withdraw with a field entry labeled uint256 withdraw_amount (see The withdraw function of Faucet.sol, in Remix).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20. The withdraw function of Faucet.sol, in Remix\n\n\nThis is the Remix interface to the contract. It allows us to construct transactions that call the functions defined in the contract. We will enter a withdraw_amount and click the withdraw button to generate the transaction.\n\n\nFirst, let’s figure out the withdraw_amount. We want to try and withdraw 0.1 ether, which is the maximum amount allowed by our contract. Remember that all currency values in Ethereum are denominated in wei internally, and our withdraw function expects the withdraw_amount to be denominated in wei too. The amount we want is 0.1 ether, which is 100,000,000,000,000,000 wei (a 1 followed by 17 zeros).\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDue to a limitation in JavaScript, a number as large as 10^17 cannot be processed by Remix. Instead, we enclose it in double quotes, to allow Remix to receive it as a string and manipulate it as a BigNumber. If we don’t enclose it in quotes, the Remix IDE will fail to process it and display \"Error encoding arguments: Error: Assertion failed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType \"100000000000000000\" (with the quotes) into the withdraw_amount box and click on the withdraw button (see Click \"withdraw\" in Remix to create a withdrawal transaction).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21. Click \"withdraw\" in Remix to create a withdrawal transaction\n\n\nMetaMask will pop up a transaction window for you to approve. Click Submit to send your withdrawal call to the contract (see MetaMask transaction to call the withdraw function).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22. MetaMask transaction to call the withdraw function\n\n\nWait a minute and then reload the Etherscan block explorer to see the transaction reflected in the Faucet contract address history (see Etherscan shows the transaction calling the withdraw function).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23. Etherscan shows the transaction calling the withdraw function\n\n\nWe now see a new transaction with the contract address as the destination and a value of 0 ether. The contract balance has changed and is now 0.9 ether because it sent us 0.1 ether as requested. But we don’t see an \"OUT\" transaction in the contract address history.\n\n\nWhere’s the outgoing withdrawal? A new tab has appeared on the contract’s address history page, named Internal Transactions. Because the 0.1 ether transfer originated from the contract code, it is an internal transaction (also called a message). Click on that tab to see it (see Etherscan shows the internal transaction transferring ether out from the contract).\n\n\nThis \"internal transaction\" was sent by the contract in this line of code (from the withdraw function in Faucet.sol):\n\n\n\nmsg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n\n\n\nTo recap: you sent a transaction from your MetaMask wallet that contained data instructions to call the withdraw function with a withdraw_amount argument of 0.1 ether. That transaction caused the contract to run inside the EVM. As the EVM ran the Faucet contract’s withdraw function, first it called the require function and validated that the requested amount was less than or equal to the maximum allowed withdrawal of 0.1 ether. Then it called the transfer function to send you the ether. Running the transfer function generated an internal transaction that deposited 0.1 ether into your wallet address, from the contract’s balance. That’s the one shown on the Internal Transactions tab in Etherscan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24. Etherscan shows the internal transaction transferring ether out from the contract\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter, you set up a wallet using MetaMask and funded it using a faucet on the Ropsten test network. You received ether into your wallet’s Ethereum address, then you sent ether to the faucet’s Ethereum address.\n\n\nNext, you wrote a faucet contract in Solidity. You used the Remix IDE to compile the contract into EVM bytecode, then used Remix to form a transaction and created the Faucet contract on the Ropsten blockchain. Once created, the Faucet contract had an Ethereum address, and you sent it some ether. Finally, you constructed a transaction to call the withdraw function and successfully asked for 0.1 ether. The contract checked the request and sent you 0.1 ether with an internal transaction.\n\n\nIt may not seem like much, but you’ve just successfully interacted with software that controls money on a decentralized world computer.\n\n\nWe will do a lot more smart contract programming in [smart_contracts_chapter] and learn about best practices and security considerations in [smart_contract_security].\n\n\n\n"},"03clients.html":{"url":"03clients.html","title":"Chapter 3: Ethereum Clients","keywords":"","body":"\nEthereum Clients\n\n\nAn Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients. Different Ethereum clients interoperate if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols. While these different clients are implemented by different teams and in different programming languages, they all \"speak\" the same protocol and follow the same rules. As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.\n\n\nEthereum is an open source project, and the source code for all the major clients is available under open source licenses (e.g., LGPL v3.0), free to download and use for any purpose. Open source means more than simply free to use, though. It also means that Ethereum is developed by an open community of volunteers and can be modified by anyone. More eyes means more trustworthy code.\n\n\nEthereum is defined by a formal specification called the \"Yellow Paper\" (see [references]).\n\n\nThis is in contrast to, for example, Bitcoin, which is not defined in any formal way. Where Bitcoin’s \"specification\" is the reference implementation Bitcoin Core, Ethereum’s specification is documented in a paper that combines an English and a mathematical (formal) specification. This formal specification, in addition to various Ethereum Improvement Proposals, defines the standard behavior of an Ethereum client. The Yellow Paper is periodically updated as major changes are made to Ethereum.\n\n\nAs a result of Ethereum’s clear formal specification, there are a number of independently developed, yet interoperable, software implementations of an Ethereum client. Ethereum has a greater diversity of implementations running on the network than any other blockchain, which is generally regarded as a good thing. Indeed, it has, for example, proven itself to be an excellent way of defending against attacks on the network, because exploitation of a particular client’s implementation strategy simply hassles the developers while they patch the exploit, while other clients keep the network running almost unaffected.\n\n\nEthereum Networks\n\nThere exist a variety of Ethereum-based networks that largely conform to the formal specification defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper, but which may or may not interoperate with each other.\n\n\nAmong these Ethereum-based networks are Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ella, Expanse, Ubiq, Musicoin, and many others. While mostly compatible at the protocol level, these networks often have features or attributes that require maintainers of Ethereum client software to make small changes in order to support each network. Because of this, not every version of Ethereum client software runs every Ethereum-based blockchain.\n\n\nCurrently, there are six main implementations of the Ethereum protocol, written in six different languages:\n\n\n\n\nParity, written in Rust\n\n\nGeth, written in Go\n\n\ncpp-ethereum, written in C++\n\n\npyethereum, written in Python\n\n\nMantis, written in Scala\n\n\nHarmony, written in Java\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will look at the two most common clients, Parity and Geth. We’ll show how to set up a node using each client, and explore some of their command-line options and application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n\nShould I Run a Full Node?\n\nThe health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains depend on them having many independently operated and geographically dispersed full nodes. Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offering the operator an authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and contracts.\n\n\nHowever, running a full node will incur a cost in hardware resources and bandwidth. A full node must download 80–100 GB of data (as of September 2018, depending on the client configuration) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added. We discuss this topic in greater detail in Hardware Requirements for a Full Node.\n\n\nA full node running on a live mainnet network is not necessary for Ethereum development. You can do almost everything you need to do with a testnet node (which connects you to one of the smaller public test blockchains), with a local private blockchain like Ganache, or with a cloud-based Ethereum client offered by a service provider like Infura.\n\n\nYou also have the option of running a remote client, which does not store a local copy of the blockchain or validate blocks and transactions. These clients offer the functionality of a wallet and can create and broadcast transactions. Remote clients can be used to connect to existing networks, such as your own full node, a public blockchain, a public or permissioned (proof-of-authority) testnet, or a private local blockchain. In practice, you will likely use a remote client such as MetaMask, Emerald Wallet, MyEtherWallet, or MyCrypto as a convenient way to switch between all of the different node options.\n\n\nThe terms \"remote client\" and \"wallet\" are used interchangeably, though there are some differences. Usually, a remote client offers an API (such as the web3.js API) in addition to the transaction functionality of a wallet.\n\n\nDo not confuse the concept of a remote wallet in Ethereum with that of a light client (which is analogous to a Simplified Payment Verification client in Bitcoin). Light clients validate block headers and use Merkle proofs to validate the inclusion of transactions in the blockchain and determine their effects, giving them a similar level of security to a full node. Conversely, Ethereum remote clients do not validate block headers or transactions. They entirely trust a full client to give them access to the blockchain, and hence lose significant security and anonymity guarantees. You can mitigate these problems by using a full client you run yourself.\n\n\n\nFull Node Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nChoosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to, but also incurs some mild to moderate costs for you. Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n\n\nSupports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks\n\n\nAuthoritatively validates all transactions\n\n\nCan interact with any contract on the public blockchain without an intermediary\n\n\nCan directly deploy contracts into the public blockchain without an intermediary\n\n\nCan query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline\n\n\nCan query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you’re reading\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n\n\nRequires significant and growing hardware and bandwidth resources\n\n\nMay require several days to fully sync when first started\n\n\nMust be maintained, upgraded, and kept online to remain synced\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Testnet Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nWhether or not you choose to run a full node, you will probably want to run a public testnet node. Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a public testnet.\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n\n\nA testnet node needs to sync and store much less data—about 10 GB depending on the network (as of April 2018).\n\n\nA testnet node can sync fully in a few hours.\n\n\nDeploying contracts or making transactions requires test ether, which has no value and can be acquired for free from several \"faucets.\"\n\n\nTestnets are public blockchains with many other users and contracts, running \"live.\"\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n\n\nYou can’t use \"real\" money on a testnet; it runs on test ether. Consequently, you can’t test security against real adversaries, as there is nothing at stake.\n\n\nThere are some aspects of a public blockchain that you cannot test realistically on a testnet. For example, transaction fees, although necessary to send transactions, are not a consideration on a testnet, since gas is free. Further, the testnets do not experience network congestion like the public mainnet sometimes does.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Blockchain Simulation Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nFor many testing purposes, the best option is to launch a single-instance private blockchain. Ganache (formerly named testrpc) is one of the most popular local blockchain simulations that you can interact with, without any other participants. It shares many of the advantages and disadvantages of the public testnet, but also has some differences.\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n\n\nNo syncing and almost no data on disk; you mine the first block yourself\n\n\nNo need to obtain test ether; you \"award\" yourself mining rewards that you can use for testing\n\n\nNo other users, just you\n\n\nNo other contracts, just the ones you deploy after you launch it\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n\n\nHaving no other users means that it doesn’t behave the same as a public blockchain. There’s no competition for transaction space or sequencing of transactions.\n\n\nNo miners other than you means that mining is more predictable; therefore, you can’t test some scenarios that occur on a public blockchain.\n\n\nHaving no other contracts means you have to deploy everything that you want to test, including dependencies and contract libraries.\n\n\nYou can’t recreate some of the public contracts and their addresses to test some scenarios (e.g., the DAO contract).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning an Ethereum Client\n\nIf you have the time and resources, you should attempt to run a full node, even if only to learn more about the process. In this section we cover how to download, compile, and run the Ethereum clients Parity and Geth. This requires some familiarity with using the command-line interface on your operating system. It’s worth installing these clients, whether you choose to run them as full nodes, as testnet nodes, or as clients to a local private blockchain.\n\n\nHardware Requirements for a Full Node\n\nBefore we get started, you should ensure you have a computer with sufficient resources to run an Ethereum full node. You will need at least 80 GB of disk space to store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain. If you also want to run a full node on the Ethereum testnet, you will need at least an additional 15 GB. Downloading 80 GB of blockchain data can take a long time, so it’s recommended that you work on a fast internet connection.\n\n\nSyncing the Ethereum blockchain is very input/output (I/O) intensive. It is best to have a solid-state drive (SSD). If you have a mechanical hard disk drive (HDD), you will need at least 8 GB of RAM to use as cache. Otherwise, you may discover that your system is too slow to keep up and sync fully.\n\n\nMinimum requirements:\n\n\n\n\nCPU with 2+ cores\n\n\nAt least 80 GB free storage space\n\n\n4 GB RAM minimum with an SSD, 8 GB+ if you have an HDD\n\n\n8 MBit/sec download internet service\n\n\n\n\nThese are the minimum requirements to sync a full (but pruned) copy of an Ethereum-based blockchain.\n\n\nAt the time of writing the Parity codebase is lighter on resources, so if you’re running with limited hardware you’ll likely see better results using Parity.\n\n\nIf you want to sync in a reasonable amount of time and store all the development tools, libraries, clients, and blockchains we discuss in this book, you will want a more capable computer.\n\n\nRecommended specifications:\n\n\n\n\nFast CPU with 4+ cores\n\n\n16 GB+ RAM\n\n\nFast SSD with at least 500 GB free space\n\n\n25+ MBit/sec download internet service\n\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to predict how fast a blockchain’s size will increase and when more disk space will be required, so it’s recommended to check the blockchain’s latest size before you start syncing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe disk size requirements listed here assume you will be running a node with default settings, where the blockchain is \"pruned\" of old state data. If you instead run a full \"archival\" node, where all state is kept on disk, it will likely require more than 1 TB of disk space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese links provide up-to-date estimates of the blockchain size:\n\n\n\n\nEthereum\n\n\nEthereum Classic\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Requirements for Building and Running a Client (Node)\n\nThis section covers Parity and Geth client software. It also assumes you are using a Unix-like command-line environment. The examples show the commands and output as they appear on an Ubuntu GNU/Linux operating system running the bash shell (command-line execution environment).\n\n\nTypically every blockchain will have its own version of Geth, while Parity provides support for multiple Ethereum-based blockchains (Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ellaism, Expanse, Musicoin) with the same client download.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn many of the examples in this chapter, we will be using the operating system’s command-line interface (also known as a \"shell\"), accessed via a \"terminal\" application. The shell will display a prompt; you type a command, and the shell responds with some text and a new prompt for your next command. The prompt may look different on your system, but in the following examples, it is denoted by a $ symbol. In the examples, when you see text after a $ symbol, don’t type the $ symbol but type the command immediately following it (shown in bold), then press Enter to execute the command. In the examples, the lines below each command are the operating system’s responses to that command. When you see the next $ prefix, you’ll know it’s a new command and you should repeat the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, you may need to install some software. If you’ve never done any software development on the computer you are currently using, you will probably need to install some basic tools. For the examples that follow, you will need to install git, the source-code management system; golang, the Go programming language and standard libraries; and Rust, a systems programming language.\n\n\nGit can be installed by following the instructions at https://git-scm.com.\n\n\nGo can be installed by following the instructions at https://golang.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGeth requirements vary, but if you stick with Go version 1.10 or greater you should be able to compile any version of Geth you want. Of course, you should always refer to the documentation for your chosen flavor of Geth.\n\n\nThe version of golang that is installed on your operating system or is available from your system’s package manager may be significantly older than 1.10. If so, remove it and install the latest version from https://golang.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRust can be installed by following the instructions at https://www.rustup.rs/.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nParity requires Rust version 1.27 or greater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParity also requires some software libraries, such as OpenSSL and libudev. To install these on a Ubuntu or Debian GNU/Linux compatible system, use the following command:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev libudev-dev cmake\n\n\nFor other operating systems, use the package manager of your OS or follow the Wiki instructions to install the required libraries.\n\n\nNow that you have git, golang, Rust, and the necessary libraries installed, let’s get to work!\n\n\n\nParity\n\nParity is an implementation of a full-node Ethereum client and DApp browser. It was written “from the ground up” in Rust, a systems programming language, with the aim of building a modular, secure, and scalable Ethereum client. Parity is developed by Parity Tech, a UK company, and is released under the GPLv3 free software license.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDisclosure: One of the authors of this book, Dr. Gavin Wood, is the founder of Parity Tech and wrote much of the Parity client. Parity represents about 25% of the installed Ethereum client base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo install Parity, you can use the Rust package manager cargo or download the source code from GitHub. The package manager also downloads the source code, so there’s not much difference between the two options. In the next section, we will show you how to download and compile Parity yourself.\n\n\nInstalling Parity\n\nThe Parity Wiki offers instructions for building Parity in different environments and containers. We’ll show you how to build Parity from source. This assumes you have already installed Rust using rustup (see Software Requirements for Building and Running a Client (Node)).\n\n\nFirst, get the source code from GitHub:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/paritytech/parity\n\n\nThen change to the parity directory and use cargo to build the executable:\n\n\n$ cd parity\n$ cargo install\n\n\nIf all goes well, you should see something like:\n\n\n$ cargo install\n    Updating git repository `https://github.com/paritytech/js-precompiled.git`\n Downloading log v0.3.7\n Downloading isatty v0.1.1\n Downloading regex v0.2.1\n\n [...]\n\nCompiling parity-ipfs-api v1.7.0\nCompiling parity-rpc v1.7.0\nCompiling parity-rpc-client v1.4.0\nCompiling rpc-cli v1.4.0 (file:///home/aantonop/Dev/parity/rpc_cli)\nFinished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 479.12 secs\n$\n\n\nTry and run parity to see if it is installed, by invoking the --version option:\n\n\n$ parity --version\nParity\n  version Parity/v1.7.0-unstable-02edc95-20170623/x86_64-linux-gnu/rustc1.18.0\nCopyright 2015, 2016, 2017 Parity Technologies (UK) Ltd\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later .\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nBy Wood/Paronyan/Kotewicz/Drwięga/Volf\n   Habermeier/Czaban/Greeff/Gotchac/Redmann\n$\n\n\nGreat! Now that Parity is installed, you can sync the blockchain and get started with some basic command-line options.\n\n\n\n\nGo-Ethereum (Geth)\n\nGeth is the Go language implementation that is actively developed by the Ethereum Foundation, so is considered the \"official\" implementation of the Ethereum client. Typically, every Ethereum-based blockchain will have its own Geth implementation. If you’re running Geth, then you’ll want to make sure you grab the correct version for your blockchain using one of the following repository links:\n\n\n\n\nEthereum (or https://geth.ethereum.org/)\n\n\nEthereum Classic\n\n\nEllaism\n\n\nExpanse\n\n\nMusicoin\n\n\nUbiq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can also skip these instructions and install a precompiled binary for your platform of choice. The precompiled releases are much easier to install and can be found in the \"releases\" section of any of the repositories listed here. However, you may learn more by downloading and compiling the software yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloning the repository\n\nThe first step is to clone the Git repository, to get a copy of the source code.\n\n\nTo make a local clone of your chosen repository, use the git command as follows, in your home directory or under any directory you use for development:\n\n\n$ git clone \n\n\nYou should see a progress report as the repository is copied to your local system:\n\n\n\nCloning into 'go-ethereum'...\nremote: Counting objects: 62587, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done.\nremote: Total 62587 (delta 10), reused 13 (delta 4), pack-reused 62557\nReceiving objects: 100% (62587/62587), 84.51 MiB | 1.40 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (41554/41554), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n\n\n\nGreat! Now that you have a local copy of Geth, you can compile an executable for your platform.\n\n\n\nBuilding Geth from source code\n\nTo build Geth, change to the directory where the source code was downloaded and use the make command:\n\n\n$ cd go-ethereum\n$ make geth\n\n\nIf all goes well, you will see the Go compiler building each component until it produces the geth executable:\n\n\n\nbuild/env.sh go run build/ci.go install ./cmd/geth\n>>> /usr/local/go/bin/go install -ldflags -X main.gitCommit=58a1e13e6dd7f52a1d...\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common/hexutil\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common/math\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto/sha3\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rlp\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto/secp256k1\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common\n[...]\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/utils\ngithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/geth\nDone building.\nRun \"build/bin/geth\" to launch geth.\n$\n\n\n\nLet’s make sure geth works without actually starting it running:\n\n\n$ ./build/bin/geth version\n\nGeth\nVersion: 1.6.6-unstable\nGit Commit: 58a1e13e6dd7f52a1d5e67bee47d23fd6cfdee5c\nArchitecture: amd64\nProtocol Versions: [63 62]\nNetwork Id: 1\nGo Version: go1.8.3\nOperating System: linux\n[...]\n\n\nYour geth version command may show slightly different information, but you should see a version report much like the one seen here.\n\n\nDon’t run geth yet, because it will start synchronizing the blockchain \"the slow way\" and that will take far too long (weeks). The next sections explains the challenge with the initial synchronization of Ethereum’s blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Synchronization of Ethereum-Based Blockchains\n\nNormally, when syncing an Ethereum blockchain, your client will download and validate every block and every transaction since the very start—i.e., from the genesis block.\n\n\nWhile it is possible to fully sync the blockchain this way, the sync will take a very long time and has high resource requirements (it will need much more RAM, and will take a very long time indeed if you don’t have fast storage).\n\n\nMany Ethereum-based blockchains were the victim of denial-of-service attacks at the end of 2016. Affected blockchains will tend to sync slowly when doing a full sync.\n\n\nFor example, on Ethereum, a new client will make rapid progress until it reaches block 2,283,397. This block was mined on September 18, 2016, and marks the beginning of the DoS attacks. From this block to block 2,700,031 (November 26, 2016), the validation of transactions becomes extremely slow, memory intensive, and I/O intensive. This results in validation times exceeding 1 minute per block. Ethereum implemented a series of upgrades, using hard forks, to address the underlying vulnerabilities that were exploited in the DoS attacks. These upgrades also cleaned up the blockchain by removing some 20 million empty accounts created by spam transactions.\n\n\nIf you are syncing with full validation, your client will slow down and may take several days, or perhaps even longer, to validate the blocks affected by the DoS attacks.\n\n\nFortunately, most Ethereum clients include an option to perform a \"fast\" synchronization that skips the full validation of transactions until it has synced to the tip of the blockchain, then resumes full validation.\n\n\nFor Geth, the option to enable fast synchronization is typically called --fast. You may need to refer to the specific instructions for your chosen Ethereum chain.\n\n\nParity does fast synchronization by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGeth can only operate fast synchronization when starting with an empty block database. If you have already started syncing without fast mode, Geth cannot switch. It is faster to delete the blockchain data directory and start fast syncing from the beginning than to continue syncing with full validation. Be careful to not delete any wallets when deleting the blockchain data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Geth or Parity\n\nNow that you understand the challenges of the \"first sync,\" you’re ready to start an Ethereum client and sync the blockchain. For both Geth and Parity, you can use the --help option to see all the configuration parameters. Other than using --fast for Geth, as outlined in the previous section, the default settings are usually sensible and appropriate for most uses. Choose how to configure any optional parameters to suit your needs, then start Geth or Parity to sync the chain. Then wait…​\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSyncing the Ethereum blockchain will take anywhere from half a day on a very fast system with lots of RAM, to several days on a slower system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe JSON-RPC Interface\n\nEthereum clients offer an application programming interface and a set of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) commands, which are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You will see this referred to as the JSON-RPC API. Essentially, the JSON-RPC API is an interface that allows us to write programs that use an Ethereum client as a gateway to an Ethereum network and blockchain.\n\n\nUsually, the RPC interface is offered as an HTTP service on port 8545. For security reasons it is restricted, by default, to only accept connections from localhost (the IP address of your own computer, which is 127.0.0.1).\n\n\nTo access the JSON-RPC API, you can use a specialized library (written in the programming language of your choice) that provides \"stub\" function calls corresponding to each available RPC command, or you can manually construct HTTP requests and send/receive JSON-encoded requests. You can even use a generic command-line HTTP client, like curl, to call the RPC interface. Let’s try that. First, ensure that you have Geth configured and running, then switch to a new terminal window (e.g., with Ctrl-Shift-N or Ctrl-Shift-T in an existing terminal window) as shown here:\n\n\n$ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data \\\n  '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' \\\n  http://localhost:8545\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\n\"result\":\"Geth/v1.8.0-unstable-02aeb3d7/linux-amd64/go1.8.3\"}\n\n\nIn this example, we use curl to make an HTTP connection to the address http://localhost:8545. We are already running geth, which offers the JSON-RPC API as an HTTP service on port 8545. We instruct curl to use the HTTP POST command and to identify the content as type application/json. Finally, we pass a JSON-encoded request as the data component of our HTTP request. Most of our command line is just setting up curl to make the HTTP connection correctly. The interesting part is the actual JSON-RPC command we issue:\n\n\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}\n\n\n\nThe JSON-RPC request is formatted according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. Each request contains four elements:\n\n\n\njsonrpc\n\nVersion of the JSON-RPC protocol. This MUST be exactly \"2.0\".\n\nmethod\n\nThe name of the method to be invoked.\n\nparams\n\nA structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.\n\nid\n\nAn identifier established by the client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. The server MUST reply with the same value in the response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe id parameter is used primarily when you are making multiple requests in a single JSON-RPC call, a practice called batching. Batching is used to avoid the overhead of a new HTTP and TCP connection for every request. In the Ethereum context, for example, we would use batching if we wanted to retrieve thousands of transactions over one HTTP connection. When batching, you set a different id for each request and then match it to the id in each response from the JSON-RPC server. The easiest way to implement this is to maintain a counter and increment the value for each request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response we receive is:\n\n\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\n\"result\":\"Geth/v1.8.0-unstable-02aeb3d7/linux-amd64/go1.8.3\"}\n\n\n\nThis tells us that the JSON-RPC API is being served by Geth client version 1.8.0.\n\n\nLet’s try something a bit more interesting. In the next example, we ask the JSON-RPC API for the current price of gas in wei:\n\n\n$ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data \\\n  '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_gasPrice\",\"params\":[],\"id\":4213}' \\\n  http://localhost:8545\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":4213,\"result\":\"0x430e23400\"}\n\n\nThe response, 0x430e23400, tells us that the current gas price is 18 gwei (gigawei or billion wei). If, like us, you don’t think in hexadecimal, you can convert it to decimal on the command line with a little bash-fu:\n\n\n$ echo $((0x430e23400))\n\n18000000000\n\n\nThe full JSON-RPC API can be investigated on the Ethereum wiki.\n\n\nParity’s Geth compatibility mode\n\nParity has a special \"Geth compatibility mode,” where it offers a JSON-RPC API that is identical to that offered by Geth. To run Parity in this mode, use the --geth switch:\n\n\n$ parity --geth\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote Ethereum Clients\n\nRemote clients offer a subset of the functionality of a full client. They do not store the full Ethereum blockchain, so they are faster to set up and require far less data storage.\n\n\nThese clients typically provide the ability to do one or more of the following:\n\n\n\n\nManage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.\n\n\nCreate, sign, and broadcast transactions.\n\n\nInteract with smart contracts, using the data payload.\n\n\nBrowse and interact with DApps.\n\n\nOffer links to external services such as block explorers.\n\n\nConvert ether units and retrieve exchange rates from external sources.\n\n\nInject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object.\n\n\nUse a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client.\n\n\nAccess RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node.\n\n\n\n\nSome remote clients, for example mobile (smartphone) wallets, offer only basic wallet functionality. Other remote clients are full-blown DApp browsers. Remote clients commonly offer some of the functions of a full-node Ethereum client without synchronizing a local copy of the Ethereum blockchain by connecting to a full node being run elsewhere, e.g., by you locally on your machine or on a web server, or by a third party on their servers.\n\n\nLet’s look at some of the most popular remote clients and the functions they offer.\n\n\nMobile (Smartphone) Wallets\n\nAll mobile wallets are remote clients, because smartphones do not have adequate resources to run a full Ethereum client. Light clients are in development and not in general use for Ethereum. In the case of Parity, the light client is marked \"experimental\" and can be used by running parity with the --light option.\n\n\nPopular mobile wallets include the following (we list these merely as examples; this is not an endorsement or an indication of the security or functionality of these wallets):\n\n\n\nJaxx\n\nA multicurrency mobile wallet based on BIP-39 mnemonic seeds, with support for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, ZCash, a variety of ERC20 tokens, and many other currencies. Jaxx is available on Android and iOS, as a browser plug-in wallet, and as a desktop wallet for a variety of operating systems.\n\nStatus\n\nA mobile wallet and DApp browser, with support for a variety of tokens and popular DApps. Available for iOS and Android.\n\nTrust Wallet\n\nA mobile Ethereum and Ethereum Classic wallet that supports ERC20 and ERC223 tokens. Trust Wallet is available for iOS and Android.\n\nCipher Browser\n\nA full-featured Ethereum-enabled mobile DApp browser and wallet that allows integration with Ethereum apps and tokens. Available for iOS and Android.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowser Wallets\n\nA variety of wallets and DApp browsers are available as plug-ins or extensions of web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. These are remote clients that run inside your browser.\n\n\nSome of the more popular ones are MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto, and Mist.\n\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetaMask, introduced in [intro_chapter], is a versatile browser-based wallet, RPC client, and basic contract explorer. It is available on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave Browser.\n\n\nUnlike other browser wallets, MetaMask injects a web3 instance into the browser JavaScript context, acting as an RPC client that connects to a variety of Ethereum blockchains (mainnet, Ropsten testnet, Kovan testnet, local RPC node, etc.). The ability to inject a web3 instance and act as a gateway to external RPC services makes MetaMask a very powerful tool for developers and users alike. It can be combined, for example, with MyEtherWallet or MyCrypto, acting as a web3 provider and RPC gateway for those tools.\n\n\n\nJaxx\n\nJaxx, which was introduced as a mobile wallet in the previous section, is also available as a Chrome and Firefox extension and as a desktop wallet.\n\n\n\nMyEtherWallet (MEW)\n\nMyEtherWallet is a browser-based JavaScript remote client that offers:\n\n\n\n\nA software wallet running in JavaScript\n\n\nA bridge to popular hardware wallets such as the Trezor and Ledger\n\n\nA web3 interface that can connect to a web3 instance injected by another client (e.g., MetaMask)\n\n\nAn RPC client that can connect to an Ethereum full client\n\n\nA basic interface that can interact with smart contracts, given a contract’s address and application binary interface (ABI)\n\n\n\n\nMyEtherWallet is very useful for testing and as an interface to hardware wallets. It should not be used as a primary software wallet, as it is exposed to threats via the browser environment and is not a secure key storage system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou must be very careful when accessing MyEtherWallet and other browser-based JavaScript wallets, as they are frequent targets for phishing. Always use a bookmark and not a search engine or link to access the correct web URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyCrypto\n\nJust prior to the publication of this book, the MyEtherWallet project split into two competing implementations, guided by two independent development teams: a \"fork,\" as it is called in open source development. The two projects are called MyEtherWallet (the original branding) and MyCrypto. At the time of the split MyCrypto offered identical functionality as MyEtherWallet, but it is likely that the two projects will diverge as the two development teams adopt different goals and priorities.\n\n\n\nMist\n\nMist was the first Ethereum-enabled browser, built by the Ethereum Foundation. It contains a browser-based wallet that was the first implementation of the ERC20 token standard (Fabian Vogelsteller, author of ERC20, was also the main developer of Mist). Mist was also the first wallet to introduce the camelCase checksum (EIP-55). Mist runs a full node, and offers a full DApp browser with support for Swarm-based storage and ENS addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we explored Ethereum clients. You downloaded, installed, and synchronized a client, becoming a participant in the Ethereum network, and contributing to the health and stability of the system by replicating the blockchain on your own computer.\n\n\n\n"},"04keys-addresses.html":{"url":"04keys-addresses.html","title":"Chapter 4: Cryptography","keywords":"","body":"\nCryptography\n\n\nOne of Ethereum’s foundational technologies is cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means \"secret writing\" in Greek, but the study of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption. Cryptography can, for example, also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (e.g., with a digital signature), or to prove the authenticity of data (e.g., with digital fingerprints, also known as \"hashes\"). These types of cryptographic proofs are mathematical tools critical to the operation of the Ethereum platform (and, indeed, all blockchain systems), and are also extensively used in Ethereum applications. \n\n\nNote that, at the time of publication, no part of the Ethereum protocol involves encryption; that is to say all communications with the Ethereum platform and between nodes (including transaction data) are unencrypted and can (necessarily) be read by anyone. This is so everyone can verify the correctness of state updates and consensus can be reached. In the future, advanced cryptographic tools, such as zero knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, will be available that will allow for some encrypted calculations to be recorded on the blockchain while still enabling consensus; however, while provision has been made for them, they have yet to be deployed.\n\n\nIn this chapter we will introduce some of the cryptography used in Ethereum: namely public key cryptography (PKC), which is used to control ownership of funds, in the form of private keys and addresses.\n\n\nKeys and Addresses\n\nAs we saw earlier in the book, Ethereum has two different types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contracts. Ownership of ether by EOAs is established through digital private keys, Ethereum addresses, and digital signatures. The private keys are at the heart of all user interaction with Ethereum. In fact, account addresses are derived directly from private keys: a private key uniquely determines a single Ethereum address, also known as an account.\n\n\nPrivate keys are not used directly in the Ethereum system in any way; they are never transmitted or stored on Ethereum. That is to say that private keys should remain private and never appear in messages passed to the network, nor should they be stored on-chain; only account addresses and digital signatures are ever transmitted and stored on the Ethereum system. For more information on how to keep private keys safe and secure, see [control_responsibility] and [wallets_chapter].\n\n\nAccess and control of funds is achieved with digital signatures, which are also created using the private key. Ethereum transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain. Anyone with a copy of a private key has control of the corresponding account and any ether it holds. Assuming a user keeps their private key safe, the digital signatures in Ethereum transactions prove the true owner of the funds, because they prove ownership of the private key.\n\n\nIn public key cryptography–based systems, such as that used by Ethereum, keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number, and the private key as similar to the secret PIN; it is the latter that provides control over the account, and the former that identifies it to others. The private keys themselves are very rarely seen by Ethereum users; for the most part, they are stored (in encrypted form) in special files and managed by Ethereum wallet software.\n\n\nIn the payment portion of an Ethereum transaction, the intended recipient is represented by an Ethereum address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary account details of a bank transfer. As we will see in more detail shortly, an Ethereum address for an EOA is generated from the public key portion of a key pair. However, not all Ethereum addresses represent public–private key pairs; they can also represent contracts, which, as we will see in [smart_contracts_chapter], are not backed by private keys.\n\n\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will first explore basic cryptography in a bit more detail and explain the mathematics used in Ethereum. Then we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed.  Finally, we will review the various encoding formats used to represent private keys, public keys, and addresses.\n\n\n\nPublic Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency\n\nPublic key cryptography (also called \"asymmetric cryptography\") is a core part of modern-day information security. The key exchange protocol, first published in the 1970s by Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie, and Ralph Merkle, was a monumental breakthrough that incited the first big wave of public interest in the field of cryptography. Before the 1970s, strong cryptographic knowledge was kept secret by governments.\n\n\nPublic key cryptography uses unique keys to secure information. These keys are based on mathematical functions that have a special property: it is easy to calculate them, but hard to calculate their inverse. Based on these functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures, which are secured by the laws of mathematics.\n\n\nFor example, multiplying two large prime numbers together is trivial. But given the product of two large primes, it is very difficult to find the prime factors (a problem called prime factorization). Let’s say we present the number 8,018,009 and tell you it is the product of two primes. Finding those two primes is much harder for you than it was for me to multiply them to produce 8,018,009.\n\n\nSome of these mathematical functions can be inverted easily if you know some secret information. In the preceding example, if I tell you that one of the prime factors is 2,003, you can trivially find the other one with a simple division: 8,018,009 ÷ 2,003 = 4,003. Such functions are often called trapdoor functions because they are very difficult to invert unless you are given a piece of secret information that can be used as a shortcut to reverse the function.\n\n\nA more advanced category of mathematical functions that is useful in cryptography is based on arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve. In elliptic curve arithmetic, multiplication modulo a prime is simple but division (the inverse) is practically impossible. This is called the discrete logarithm problem and there are currently no known trapdoors. Elliptic curve cryptography is used extensively in modern computer systems and is the basis of Ethereum’s (and other cryptocurrencies') use of private keys and digital signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTake a look at the following resources if you’re interested in reading more about cryptography and the mathematical functions that are used in modern cryptography:\n\n\n\n\nCryptography\n\n\nTrapdoor function\n\n\nPrime factorization\n\n\nDiscrete logarithm\n\n\nElliptic curve cryptography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ethereum, we use public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography) to create the public–private key pair we have been talking about in this chapter. They are considered a \"pair\" because the public key is derived from the private key. Together, they represent an Ethereum account by providing, respectively, a publicly accessible account handle (the address) and private control over access to any ether in the account and over any authentication the account needs when using smart contracts. The private key controls access by being the unique piece of information needed to create digital signatures, which are required to sign transactions to spend any funds in the account. Digital signatures are also used to authenticate owners or users of contracts, as we will see in [smart_contracts_chapter].\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public key can be trivially calculated from the private key, so storing only the private key is also possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA digital signature can be created to sign any message. For Ethereum transactions, the details of the transaction itself are used as the message. The mathematics of cryptography—in this case, elliptic curve cryptography—provides a way for the message (i.e., the transaction details) to be combined with the private key to create a code that can only be produced with knowledge of the private key. That\ncode is called the digital signature. Note that an Ethereum transaction is basically a request to access a particular account with a particular Ethereum address. When a transaction is sent to the Ethereum network in order to move funds or interact with smart contracts, it needs to be sent with a digital signature created with the private key corresponding to the Ethereum address in question. Elliptic curve mathematics means that anyone can verify that a transaction is valid, by checking that the digital signature matches the transaction details and the Ethereum address to which access is being requested. The verification doesn’t involve the private key at all; that remains private. However, the verification process determines beyond doubt that the transaction could have only come from someone with the private key that corresponds to the public key behind the Ethereum address. This is the \"magic\" of public key cryptography.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere is no encryption as part of the Ethereum protocol—all messages that are sent as part of the operation of the Ethereum network can (necessarily) be read by everyone. As such, private keys are only used to create digital signatures for transaction authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Keys\n\nA private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control of the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the corresponding Ethereum address, as well as access to contracts that authorize that address. The private key is used to create signatures required to spend ether by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the ether and contracts secured by that private key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss. If it’s lost, it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are lost forever too.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum private key is just a number. One way to pick your private keys randomly is to simply use a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256 times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can use in an Ethereum wallet (probably—see the next section). The public key and address can then be generated from the private key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating a Private Key from a Random Number\n\nThe first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating an Ethereum private key essentially involves picking a number between 1 and 2256. The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or deterministic. Ethereum software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generator to produce 256 random bits. Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds, or press random keys on your keyboard. An alternative could be cosmic radiation noise on the computer’s microphone channel.\n\n\nMore precisely, a private key can be any nonzero number up to a very large number slightly less than 2256—a huge 78-digit number, roughly 1.158 * 1077. The exact number shares the first 38 digits with 2256 and is defined as the order of the elliptic curve used in Ethereum (see Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained). To create a private key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is within the valid range. In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding an even larger string of random bits (collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness) into a 256-bit hash algorithm such as Keccak-256 or SHA-256, both of which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number. If the result is within the valid range, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we simply try again with another random number.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n2256—the size of Ethereum’s private key space—is an unfathomably large number. It is approximately 1077 in decimal; that is, a number with 77 digits. For comparison, the visible universe is estimated to contain 1080 atoms. Thus, there are almost enough private keys to give every atom in the universe an Ethereum account. If you pick a private key randomly, there is no conceivable way anyone will ever guess it or pick it themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the private key generation process is an offline one; it does not require any communication with the Ethereum network, or indeed any communication with anyone at all. As such, in order to pick a number that no one else will ever pick, it needs to be truly random. If you choose the number yourself, the chance that someone else will try it (and then run off with your ether) is too high. Using a bad random number generator (like the pseudorandom rand function in most programming languages) is even worse, because it is even more obvious and even easier to replicate. Just like with passwords for online accounts, the private key needs to be unguessable. Fortunately, you never need to remember your private key, so you can take the best possible approach for picking it: namely, true randomness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDo not write your own code to create a random number or use a \"simple\" random number generator offered by your programming language. It is vital that you use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (such as CSPRNG) with a seed from a source of sufficient entropy. Study the documentation of the random number generator library you choose to make sure it is cryptographically secure. Correct implementation of the CSPRNG library is critical to the security of the keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a randomly generated private key shown in hexadecimal format (256 bits shown as 64 hexadecimal digits, each 4 bits):\n\n\n\nf8f8a2f43c8376ccb0871305060d7b27b0554d2cc72bccf41b2705608452f315\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Keys\n\nAn Ethereum public key is a point on an elliptic curve, meaning it is a set of x and y coordinates that satisfy the elliptic curve equation.\n\n\nIn simpler terms, an Ethereum public key is two numbers, joined together. These numbers are produced from the private key by a calculation that can only go one way. That means that it is trivial to calculate a public key if you have the private key, but you cannot calculate the private key from the public key.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMATH is about to happen! Don’t panic. If you start to get lost at any point in the following paragraphs, you can skip the next few sections. There are many tools and libraries that will do the math for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is practically irreversible: K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point, K is the resulting public key, and * is the special elliptic curve \"multiplication\" operator. Note that elliptic curve multiplication is not like normal multiplication. It shares functional attributes with normal multiplication, but that is about it. For example, the reverse operation (which would be division for normal numbers), known as \"finding the discrete logarithm”—i.e., calculating k if you know K—is as difficult as trying all possible values of k (a brute-force search that will likely take more time than this universe will allow for).\n\n\nIn simpler terms: arithmetic on the elliptic curve is different from \"regular\" integer arithmetic. A point (G) can be multiplied by an integer (k) to produce another point (K). But there is no such thing as division, so it is not possible to simply \"divide\" the public key K by the point G to calculate the private key k. This is the one-way mathematical function described in Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nElliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptographers call a \"one-way\" function: it is easy to do in one direction (multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (division). The owner of the private key can easily create the public key and then share it with the world, knowing that no one can reverse the function and calculate the private key from the public key. This mathematical trick becomes the basis for unforgeable and secure digital signatures that prove ownership of Ethereum funds and control of contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we demonstrate how to generate a public key from a private key, let’s look at elliptic curve cryptography in a bit more detail.\n\n\nElliptic Curve Cryptography Explained\n\nElliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of an elliptic curve.\n\n\nA visualization of an elliptic curve is an example of an elliptic curve, similar to that used by Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEthereum uses the exact same elliptic curve, called secp256k1, as Bitcoin. That makes it possible to reuse many of the elliptic curve libraries and tools from Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A visualization of an elliptic curve\n\n\nEthereum uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants, as defined in a standard called secp256k1, established by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following function, which produces an elliptic curve:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      y 2 \n      =\n      \n        (\n        x 3 \n        +\n        7\n        )\n      \n    \n    \n    over\n    \n    \n      (\n      &#x1d53d; p \n      )\n    \n  \n\n\n\nor:\n\n\n\n  \n    y 2 \n    \n    mod\n    \n    p\n    =\n    \n      (\n      x 3 \n      +\n      7\n      )\n    \n    \n    mod\n    \n    p\n  \n\n\n\nThe mod p (modulo prime number p) indicates that this curve is over a finite field of prime order p, also written as \\(\\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\)\\), where p = 2256 – 232 – 29 – 28 – 27 – 26 – 24 – 1, which is a very large prime number.\n\n\nBecause this curve is defined over a finite field of prime order instead of over the real numbers, it looks like a pattern of dots scattered in two dimensions, which makes it difficult to visualize. However, the math is identical to that of an elliptic curve over real numbers. As an example, Elliptic curve cryptography: visualizing an elliptic curve over F(p), with p=17 shows the same elliptic curve over a much smaller finite field of prime order 17, showing a pattern of dots on a grid. The secp256k1 Ethereum elliptic curve can be thought of as a much more complex pattern of dots on an unfathomably large grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Elliptic curve cryptography: visualizing an elliptic curve over F(p), with p=17\n\n\nSo, for example, the following is a point Q with coordinates (x,y) that is a point on the secp256k1 curve:\n\n\n\nQ =\n(49790390825249384486033144355916864607616083520101638681403973749255924539515,\n59574132161899900045862086493921015780032175291755807399284007721050341297360)\n\n\n\n[example_1] shows how you can check this yourself using Python. The variables x and y are the coordinates of the point Q, as in the preceding example. The variable p is the prime order of the elliptic curve (the prime that is used for all the modulo operations). The last line of Python is the elliptic curve equation (the % operator in Python is the modulo operator). If x and y are indeed the coordinates of a point on the elliptic curve, then they satisfy the equation and the result is zero (0L is a long integer with value zero). Try it yourself, by typing **python** on a command line and copying each line (after the prompt >>>) from the listing.\n\n\nUsing Python to confirm that this point is on the elliptic curve\n\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Mar 30 2014, 19:23:13)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang-503.0.38)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834 \\\n671663\n>>> x = 49790390825249384486033144355916864607616083520101638681403973749255924539515\n>>> y = 59574132161899900045862086493921015780032175291755807399284007721050341297360\n>>> (x ** 3 + 7 - y**2) % p\n0L\n\n\n\n\nElliptic Curve Arithmetic Operations\n\nA lot of elliptic curve math looks and works very much like the integer arithmetic we learned at school. Specifically, we can define an addition operator, which instead of jumping along the number line is jumping to other points on the curve. Once we have the addition operator, we can also define multiplication of a point and a whole number, which is equivalent to repeated addition.\n\n\nElliptic curve addition is defined such that given two points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 + P2, also on the elliptic curve.\n\n\nGeometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between P1 and P2. This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional place (amazingly). Call this point P3' = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).\n\n\nIf P1 and P2 are the same point, the line \"between\" P1 and P2 should extend to be the tangent to the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the curve at exactly one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope of the tangent line. Curiously, these techniques work, even though we are restricting our interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!\n\n\nIn elliptic curve math, there is also a point called the \"point at infinity,\" which roughly corresponds to the role of the number zero in addition. On computers, it’s sometimes represented by x = y = 0 (which doesn’t satisfy the elliptic curve equation, but it’s an easy separate case that can be checked). There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the point at infinity.\n\n\nIn some cases (e.g., if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y values), the line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = the point at infinity.\n\n\nIf P1 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is the point at infinity, then P1 + P2 = P1. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role that zero plays in \"normal\" arithmetic.\n\n\nIt turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). That means we can write A + B + C (without parentheses) without ambiguity.\n\n\nNow that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the standard way that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a whole number, then k * P = P + P + P + …​ + P (k times). Note that k is sometimes (perhaps confusingly) called an \"exponent\" in this case.\n\n\n\nGenerating a Public Key\n\nStarting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k, we multiply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G to produce another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding public key K:\n\n\n\n  \n    K\n    =\n    k\n    *\n    G\n  \n\n\n\nThe generator point is specified as part of the secp256k1 standard; it is the same for all implementations of secp256k1, and all keys derived from that curve use the same point G. Because the generator point is always the same for all Ethereum users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same public key K. The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction, from k to K. That’s why an Ethereum address (derived from K) can be shared with anyone and does not reveal the user’s private key (k).\n\n\nAs we described in the previous section, the multiplication of k * G is equivalent to repeated addition, so G + G + G + …​ + G, repeated k times. In summary, to produce a public key K from a private key k, we add the generator point G to itself, k times.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted back into a private key, because the math only works one way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s apply this calculation to find the public key for the specific private key we showed you in Private Keys:\n\n\nExample private key to public key calculation\n\nK = f8f8a2f43c8376ccb0871305060d7b27b0554d2cc72bccf41b2705608452f315 * G\n\n\n\nA cryptographic library can help us calculate K, using elliptic curve multiplication. The resulting public key K is defined as the point:\n\n\n\nK = (x, y)\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\nx = 6e145ccef1033dea239875dd00dfb4fee6e3348b84985c92f103444683bae07b\ny = 83b5c38e5e2b0c8529d7fa3f64d46daa1ece2d9ac14cab9477d042c84c32ccd0\n\n\n\nIn Ethereum you may see public keys represented as a serialization of 130 hexadecimal characters (65 bytes). This is adopted from a standard serialization format proposed by the industry consortium Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), documented in Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SEC1). The standard defines four possible prefixes that can be used to identify points on an elliptic curve, listed in Serialized EC public key prefixes.\n\n\nTable 1. Serialized EC public key prefixes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefix\nMeaning\nLength (bytes counting prefix)\n\n\n\n\n0x00\nPoint at infinity\n1\n\n\n0x04\nUncompressed point\n65\n\n\n0x02\nCompressed point with even y\n33\n\n\n0x03\nCompressed point with odd y\n33\n\n\n\n\nEthereum only uses uncompressed public keys; therefore the only prefix that is relevant is (hex) 04. The serialization concatenates the x and y coordinates of the public key:\n\n\n\n04 + x-coordinate (32 bytes/64 hex) + y-coordinate (32 bytes/64 hex)\n\n\n\nTherefore, the public key we calculated earlier is serialized as:\n\n\n\n046e145ccef1033dea239875dd00dfb4fee6e3348b84985c92f103444683bae07b83b5c38e5e2b0 \\\nc8529d7fa3f64d46daa1ece2d9ac14cab9477d042c84c32ccd0\n\n\n\n\nElliptic Curve Libraries\n\nThere are a couple of implementations of the secp256k1 elliptic curve that are used in cryptocurrency-related projects:\n\n\n\nOpenSSL\n\nThe OpenSSL library offers a comprehensive set of cryptographic primitives, including a full implementation of secp256k1. For example, to derive the public key, the function EC_POINT_mul can be used.\n\nlibsecp256k1\n\nBitcoin Core’s libsecp256k1 is a C-language implementation of the secp256k1 elliptic curve and other cryptographic primitives. It was written from scratch to replace OpenSSL in Bitcoin Core software, and is considered superior in both performance and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions\n\nCryptographic hash functions are used throughout Ethereum. In fact, hash functions are used extensively in almost all cryptographic systems—a fact captured by cryptographer Bruce Schneier, who said, \"Much more than encryption algorithms, one-way hash functions are the workhorses of modern cryptography.\"\n\n\nIn this section we will discuss hash functions, explore their basic properties, and see how those properties make them so useful in so many areas of modern cryptography. We address hash functions here because they are part of the transformation of Ethereum public keys into addresses. They can also be used to create digital fingerprints, which aid in the verification of data.\n\n\nIn simple terms, a hash function is “any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.” The input to a hash function is called a pre-image, the message, or simply the input data. The output is called the hash. Cryptographic hash functions are a special subcategory that have specific properties that are useful to secure platforms, such as Ethereum.\n\n\nA cryptographic hash function is a one-way hash function that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size string of bits. The \"one-way\" nature means that it is computationally infeasible to recreate the input data if one only knows the output hash. The only way to determine a possible input is to conduct a brute-force search, checking each candidate for a matching output; given that the search space is virtually infinite, it is easy to understand the practical impossibility of the task. Even if you find some input data that creates a matching hash, it may not be the original input data: hash functions are \"many-to-one\" functions. Finding two sets of input data that hash to the same output is called finding a hash collision. Roughly speaking, the better the hash function, the rarer hash collisions are. For Ethereum, they are effectively impossible.\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the main properties of cryptographic hash functions. These include:\n\n\n\nDeterminism\n\nA given input message always produces the same hash output.\n\nVerifiability\n\nComputing the hash of a message is efficient (linear complexity).\n\nNoncorrelation\n\nA small change to the message (e.g., a 1-bit change) should change the hash output so extensively that it cannot be correlated to the hash of the original message.\n\nIrreversibility\n\nComputing the message from its hash is infeasible, equivalent to a brute-force search through all possible messages.\n\nCollision protection\n\nIt should be infeasible to calculate two different messages that produce the same hash output.\n\n\n\n\nResistance to hash collisions is particularly important for avoiding digital signature forgery in Ethereum.\n\n\nThe combination of these properties make cryptographic hash functions useful for a broad range of security applications, including:\n\n\n\n\nData fingerprinting\n\n\nMessage integrity (error detection)\n\n\nProof of work\n\n\nAuthentication (password hashing and key stretching)\n\n\nPseudorandom number generators\n\n\nMessage commitment (commit–reveal mechanisms)\n\n\nUnique identifiers\n\n\n\n\nWe will find many of these in Ethereum as we progress through the various layers of the system.\n\n\nEthereum’s Cryptographic Hash Function: Keccak-256\n\nEthereum uses the Keccak-256 cryptographic hash function in many places. Keccak-256 was designed as a candidate for the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Function Competition held in 2007 by the National Institute of Science and Technology. Keccak was the winning algorithm, which became standardized as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202 in 2015.\n\n\nHowever, during the period when Ethereum was developed, the NIST standardization was not yet finalized. NIST adjusted some of the parameters of Keccak after the completion of the standards process, allegedly to improve its efficiency. This was occurring at the same time as heroic whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed documents that imply that NIST may have been improperly influenced by the National Security Agency to intentionally weaken the Dual_EC_DRBG random-number generator standard, effectively placing a backdoor in the standard random number generator. The result of this controversy was a backlash against the proposed changes and a significant delay in the standardization of SHA-3. At the time, the Ethereum Foundation decided to implement the original Keccak algorithm, as proposed by its inventors, rather than the SHA-3 standard as modified by NIST.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile you may see \"SHA-3\" mentioned throughout Ethereum documents and code, many if not all of those instances actually refer to Keccak-256, not the finalized FIPS-202 SHA-3 standard. The implementation differences are slight, having to do with padding parameters, but they are significant in that Keccak-256 produces different hash outputs from FIPS-202 SHA-3 for the same input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Hash Function Am I Using?\n\nHow can you tell if the software library you are using implements FIPS-202 SHA-3 or Keccak-256, if both might be called \"SHA-3\"?\n\n\nAn easy way to tell is to use a test vector, an expected output for a given input. The test most commonly used for a hash function is the empty input. If you run the hash function with an empty string as input you should see the following results:\n\n\n\nKeccak256(\"\") =\n  c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470\n\nSHA3(\"\") =\n  a7ffc6f8bf1ed76651c14756a061d662f580ff4de43b49fa82d80a4b80f8434a\n\n\n\nRegardless of what the function is called, you can test it to see whether it is the original Keccak-256 or the final NIST standard FIPS-202 SHA-3 by running this simple test. Remember, Ethereum uses Keccak-256, even though it is often called SHA-3 in the code.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to the confusion created by the difference between the hash function used in Ethereum (Keccak-256) and the finalized standard (FIP-202 SHA-3), there is an effort underway to rename all instances of sha3 in all code, opcodes, and libraries to keccak256. See ERC59 for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s examine the first application of Keccak-256 in Ethereum, which is to produce Ethereum addresses from public keys.\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Addresses\n\nEthereum addresses are unique identifiers that are derived from public keys or contracts using the Keccak-256 one-way hash function.\n\n\nIn our previous examples, we started with a private key and used elliptic curve multiplication to derive a public key:\n\n\nPrivate key k:\n\n\n\nk = f8f8a2f43c8376ccb0871305060d7b27b0554d2cc72bccf41b2705608452f315\n\n\n\nPublic key K (x and y coordinates concatenated and shown as hex):\n\n\n\nK = 6e145ccef1033dea239875dd00dfb4fee6e3348b84985c92f103444683bae07b83b5c38e5e...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the public key is not formatted with the prefix (hex) 04 when the address is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use Keccak-256 to calculate the hash of this public key:\n\n\n\nKeccak256(K) = 2a5bc342ed616b5ba5732269001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\n\n\n\nThen we keep only the last 20 bytes (least significant bytes), which is our Ethereum address:\n\n\n\n001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\n\n\n\nMost often you will see Ethereum addresses with the prefix 0x that indicates they are hexadecimal-encoded, like this:\n\n\n\n0x001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\n\n\n\nEthereum Address Formats\n\nEthereum addresses are hexadecimal numbers, identifiers derived from the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key.\n\n\nUnlike Bitcoin addresses, which are encoded in the user interface of all clients to include a built-in checksum to protect against mistyped addresses, Ethereum addresses are presented as raw hexadecimal without any checksum.\n\n\nThe rationale behind that decision was that Ethereum addresses would eventually be hidden behind abstractions (such as name services) at higher layers of the system and that checksums should be added at higher layers if necessary.\n\n\nIn reality, these higher layers were developed too slowly and this design choice led to a number of problems in the early days of the ecosystem, including the loss of funds due to mistyped addresses and input validation errors. Furthermore, because Ethereum name services were developed slower than initially expected, alternative encodings were adopted very slowly by wallet developers. We’ll look at a few of the encoding options next.\n\n\n\nInter Exchange Client Address Protocol\n\nThe Inter exchange Client Address Protocol (ICAP) is an Ethereum address encoding that is partly compatible with the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) encoding, offering a versatile, checksummed, and interoperable encoding for Ethereum addresses. ICAP addresses can encode Ethereum addresses or common names registered with an Ethereum name registry. You can read more about ICAP on the Ethereum Wiki.\n\n\nIBAN is an international standard for identifying bank account numbers, mostly used for wire transfers. It is broadly adopted in the European Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and beyond. IBAN is a centralized and heavily regulated service. ICAP is a decentralized but compatible implementation for Ethereum addresses.\n\n\nAn IBAN consists of a string of up to 34 alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) comprising a country code, checksum, and bank account identifier (which is country-specific).\n\n\nICAP uses the same structure by introducing a nonstandard country code, “XE,” that stands for \"Ethereum,” followed by a two-character checksum and three possible variations of an account identifier:\n\n\n\nDirect\n\nA big-endian base-36 integer comprised of up to 30 alphanumeric characters, representing the 155 least significant bits of an Ethereum address. Because this encoding fits less than the full 160 bits of a general Ethereum address, it only works for Ethereum addresses that start with one or more zero bytes. The advantage is that it is compatible with IBAN, in terms of the field length and checksum. Example: XE60HAMICDXSV5QXVJA7TJW47Q9CHWKJD (33 characters long).\n\nBasic\n\nSame as the Direct encoding, except that it is 31 characters long. This allows it to encode any Ethereum address, but makes it incompatible with IBAN field validation. Example: XE18CHDJBPLTBCJ03FE9O2NS0BPOJVQCU2P (35 characters long).\n\nIndirect\n\nEncodes an identifier that resolves to an Ethereum address through a name registry provider. It uses 16 alphanumeric characters, comprising an asset identifier (e.g., ETH), a name service (e.g., XREG), and a 9-character human-readable name (e.g., KITTYCATS). Example: XE##ETHXREGKITTYCATS (20 characters long), where the ## should be replaced by the two computed checksum characters.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the helpeth command-line tool to create ICAP addresses. Let’s try with our example private key (prefixed with 0x and passed as a parameter to helpeth):\n\n\n$ helpeth keyDetails \\\n  -p 0xf8f8a2f43c8376ccb0871305060d7b27b0554d2cc72bccf41b2705608452f315\n\nAddress: 0x001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\nICAP: XE60 HAMI CDXS V5QX VJA7 TJW4 7Q9C HWKJ D\nPublic key: 0x6e145ccef1033dea239875dd00dfb4fee6e3348b84985c92f103444683bae07b...\n\n\nThe helpeth command constructs a hexadecimal Ethereum address as well as an ICAP address for us. The ICAP address for our example key is:\n\n\n\nXE60HAMICDXSV5QXVJA7TJW47Q9CHWKJD\n\n\n\nBecause our example Ethereum address happens to start with a zero byte, it can be encoded using the Direct ICAP encoding method that is valid in IBAN format. You can tell because it is 33 characters long.\n\n\nIf our address did not start with a zero, it would be encoded with the Basic encoding, which would be 35 characters long and invalid as an IBAN.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe chances of any Ethereum address starting with a zero byte are 1 in 256. To generate one like that, it will take on average 256 attempts with 256 different random private keys before we find one that works as an IBAN-compatible \"Direct\" encoded ICAP address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, ICAP is unfortunately only supported by a few wallets.\n\n\n\nHex Encoding with Checksum in Capitalization (EIP-55)\n\nDue to the slow deployment of ICAP and name services, a standard was proposed by Ethereum Improvement Proposal 55 (EIP-55). EIP-55 offers a backward-compatible checksum for Ethereum addresses by modifying the capitalization of the hexadecimal address. The idea is that Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive and all wallets are supposed to accept Ethereum addresses expressed in capital or lowercase characters, without any difference in interpretation.\n\n\nBy modifying the capitalization of the alphabetic characters in the address, we can convey a checksum that can be used to protect the integrity of the address against typing or reading mistakes. Wallets that do not support EIP-55 checksums simply ignore the fact that the address contains mixed capitalization, but those that do support it can validate it and detect errors with a 99.986% accuracy.\n\n\nThe mixed-capitals encoding is subtle and you may not notice it at first. Our example address is:\n\n\n\n0x001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\n\n\n\nWith an EIP-55 mixed-capitalization checksum it becomes:\n\n\n\n0x001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0F9\n\n\n\nCan you tell the difference? Some of the alphabetic (A–F) characters from the hexadecimal encoding alphabet are now capital, while others are lowercase.\n\n\nEIP-55 is quite simple to implement. We take the Keccak-256 hash of the lowercase hexadecimal address. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint of the address, giving us a convenient checksum. Any small change in the input (the address) should cause a big change in the resulting hash (the checksum), allowing us to detect errors effectively. The hash of our address is then encoded in the capitalization of the address itself. Let’s break it down, step by step:\n\n\n\n\nHash the lowercase address, without the 0x prefix:\n\n\n\n\n\nKeccak256(\"001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\") =\n23a69c1653e4ebbb619b0b2cb8a9bad49892a8b9695d9a19d8f673ca991deae1\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalize each alphabetic address character if the corresponding hex digit of the hash is greater than or equal to 0x8. This is easier to show if we line up the address and the hash:\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress: 001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\nHash   : 23a69c1653e4ebbb619b0b2cb8a9bad49892a8b9...\n\n\n\nOur address contains an alphabetic character d in the fourth position. The fourth character of the hash is 6, which is less than 8. So, we leave the d lowercase. The next alphabetic character in our address is f, in the sixth position. The sixth character of the hexadecimal hash is c, which is greater than 8. Therefore, we capitalize the F in the address, and so on. As you can see, we only use the first 20 bytes (40 hex characters) of the hash as a checksum, since we only have 20 bytes (40 hex characters) in the address to capitalize appropriately.\n\n\nCheck the resulting mixed-capitals address yourself and see if you can tell which characters were capitalized and which characters they correspond to in the address hash:\n\n\n\nAddress: 001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0F9\nHash   : 23a69c1653e4ebbb619b0b2cb8a9bad49892a8b9...\n\n\n\nDetecting an error in an EIP-55 encoded address\n\nNow, let’s look at how EIP-55 addresses will help us find an error. Let’s assume we have printed out an Ethereum address, which is EIP-55 encoded:\n\n\n\n0x001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0F9\n\n\n\nNow let’s make a basic mistake in reading that address. The character before the last one is a capital F. For this example let’s assume we misread that as a capital E, and we type the following (incorrect) address into our wallet:\n\n\n\n0x001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0E9\n\n\n\nFortunately, our wallet is EIP-55 compliant! It notices the mixed capitalization and attempts to validate the address. It converts it to lowercase, and calculates the checksum hash:\n\n\n\nKeccak256(\"001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0e9\") =\n5429b5d9460122fb4b11af9cb88b7bb76d8928862e0a57d46dd18dd8e08a6927\n\n\n\nAs you can see, even though the address has only changed by one character (in fact, only one bit, as e and f are one bit apart), the hash of the address has changed radically. That’s the property of hash functions that makes them so useful for checksums!\n\n\nNow, let’s line up the two and check the capitalization:\n\n\n\n001d3F1ef827552Ae1114027BD3ECF1f086bA0E9\n5429b5d9460122fb4b11af9cb88b7bb76d892886...\n\n\n\nIt’s all wrong! Several of the alphabetic characters are incorrectly capitalized. Remember that the capitalization is the encoding of the correct checksum.\n\n\nThe capitalization of the address we input doesn’t match the checksum just calculated, meaning something has changed in the address, and an error has been introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we provided a brief survey of public key cryptography and focused on the use of public and private keys in Ethereum and the use of cryptographic tools, such as hash functions, in the creation and verification of Ethereum addresses. We also looked at digital signatures and how they can demonstrate ownership of a private key without revealing that private key. In [wallets_chapter], we will put these ideas together and look at how wallets can be used to manage collections of keys.\n\n\n\n"},"05wallets.html":{"url":"05wallets.html","title":"Chapter 5: Wallets","keywords":"","body":"\nWallets\n\n\nThe word \"wallet\" is used to describe a few different things in Ethereum.\n\n\nAt a high level, a wallet is a software application that serves as the primary user interface to Ethereum. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions. In addition, some Ethereum wallets can also interact with contracts, such as ERC20 tokens.\n\n\nMore narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word wallet refers to the system used to store and manage a user’s keys. Every wallet has a key-management component. For some wallets, that’s all there is. Other wallets are part of a much broader category, that of browsers, which are interfaces to Ethereum-based decentralized applications, or DApps, which we will examine in more detail in [decentralized_applications_chap]. There are no clear lines of distinction between the various categories that are conflated under the term wallet.\n\n\nIn this chapter we will look at wallets as containers for private keys, and as systems for managing these keys.\n\n\nWallet Technology Overview\n\nIn this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct user-friendly, secure, and flexible Ethereum wallets.\n\n\nOne key consideration in designing wallets is balancing convenience and privacy. The most convenient Ethereum wallet is one with a single private key and address that you reuse for everything. Unfortunately, such a solution is a privacy nightmare, as anyone can easily track and correlate all your transactions. Using a new key for every transaction is best for privacy, but becomes very difficult to manage. The correct balance is difficult to achieve, but that’s why good wallet design is paramount.\n\n\nA common misconception about Ethereum is that Ethereum wallets contain ether or tokens. In fact, very strictly speaking, the wallet holds only keys. The ether or other tokens are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Users control the tokens on the network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets. In a sense, an Ethereum wallet is a keychain. Having said that, given that the keys held by the wallet are the only things that are needed to transfer ether or tokens to others, in practice this distinction is fairly irrelevant. Where the difference does matter is in changing one’s mindset from dealing with the centralized system of conventional banking (where only you, and the bank, can see the money in your account, and you only need convince the bank that you want to move funds to make a transaction) to the decentralized system of blockchain platforms (where everyone can see the ether balance of an account, although they probably don’t know the account’s owner, and everyone needs to be convinced the owner wants to move funds for a transaction to be enacted). In practice this means that there is an independent way to check an account’s balance, without needing its wallet. Moreover, you can move your account handling from your current wallet to a different wallet, if you grow to dislike the wallet app you started out using.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEthereum wallets contain keys, not ether or tokens. Wallets are like keychains containing pairs of private and public keys. Users sign transactions with the private keys, thereby proving they own the ether. The ether is stored on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys they contain are related to each other or not.\n\n\nThe first type is a nondeterministic wallet, where each key is independently generated from a different random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of wallet is also known as a JBOK wallet, from the phrase \"Just a Bunch of Keys.”\n\n\nThe second type of wallet is a deterministic wallet, where all the keys are derived from a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of wallet are related to each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There are a number of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. The most commonly used derivation method uses a tree-like structure, as described in Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44).\n\n\nTo make deterministic wallets slightly more secure against data-loss accidents, such as having your phone stolen or dropping it in the toilet, the seeds are often encoded as a list of words (in English or another language) for you to write down and use in the event of an accident. These are known as the wallet’s mnemonic code words. Of course, if someone gets hold of your mnemonic code words, then they can also recreate your wallet and thus gain access to your ether and smart contracts. As such, be very, very careful with your recovery word list! Never store it electronically, in a file, on your computer or phone. Write it down on paper and store it in a safe and secure place.\n\n\nThe next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high level.\n\n\nNondeterministic (Random) Wallets\n\nIn the first Ethereum wallet (produced for the Ethereum pre-sale), each wallet file stored a single randomly generated private key. Such wallets are being replaced with deterministic wallets because these \"old-style\" wallets are in many ways inferior. For example, it is considered good practice to avoid Ethereum address reuse as part of maximizing your privacy while using Ethereum—i.e., to use a new address (which needs a new private key) every time you receive funds. You can go further and use a new address for each transaction, although this can get expensive if you deal a lot with tokens. To follow this practice, a nondeterministic wallet will need to regularly increase its list of keys, which means you will need to make regular backups. If you ever lose your data (disk failure, drink accident, phone stolen) before you’ve managed to back up your wallet, you will lose access to your funds and smart contracts. The \"type 0\" nondeterministic wallets are the hardest to deal with, because they create a new wallet file for every new address in a \"just in time\" manner.\n\n\nNevertheless, many Ethereum clients (including geth) use a keystore file, which is a JSON-encoded file that contains a single (randomly generated) private key, encrypted by a passphrase for extra security. The JSON file’s contents look like this:\n\n\n\n{\n    \"address\": \"001d3f1ef827552ae1114027bd3ecf1f086ba0f9\",\n    \"crypto\": {\n        \"cipher\": \"aes-128-ctr\",\n        \"ciphertext\":\n            \"233a9f4d236ed0c13394b504b6da5df02587c8bf1ad8946f6f2b58f055507ece\",\n        \"cipherparams\": {\n            \"iv\": \"d10c6ec5bae81b6cb9144de81037fa15\"\n        },\n        \"kdf\": \"scrypt\",\n        \"kdfparams\": {\n            \"dklen\": 32,\n            \"n\": 262144,\n            \"p\": 1,\n            \"r\": 8,\n            \"salt\":\n                \"99d37a47c7c9429c66976f643f386a61b78b97f3246adca89abe4245d2788407\"\n        },\n        \"mac\": \"594c8df1c8ee0ded8255a50caf07e8c12061fd859f4b7c76ab704b17c957e842\"\n    },\n    \"id\": \"4fcb2ba4-ccdb-424f-89d5-26cce304bf9c\",\n    \"version\": 3\n}\n\n\n\nThe keystore format uses a key derivation function (KDF), also known as a password stretching algorithm, which protects against brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks. In simple terms, the private key is not encrypted by the passphrase directly. Instead, the passphrase is stretched, by repeatedly hashing it. The hashing function is repeated for 262,144 rounds, which can be seen in the keystore JSON as the parameter crypto.kdfparams.n. An attacker trying to brute-force the passphrase would have to apply 262,144 rounds of hashing for every attempted passphrase, which slows down the attack sufficiently to make it infeasible for passphrases of sufficient complexity and length.\n\n\nThere are a number of software libraries that can read and write the keystore format, such as the JavaScript library keythereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe use of nondeterministic wallets is discouraged for anything other than simple tests. They are too cumbersome to back up and use for anything but the most basic of situations. Instead, use an industry-standard–based HD wallet with a mnemonic seed for backup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeterministic (Seeded) Wallets\n\nDeterministic or \"seeded\" wallets are wallets that contain private keys that are all derived from a single master key, or seed. The seed is a randomly generated number that is combined with other data, such as an index number or \"chain code\" (see Extended public and private keys), to derive any number of private keys. In a deterministic wallet, the seed is sufficient to recover all the derived keys, and therefore a single backup, at creation time, is sufficient to secure all the funds and smart contracts in the wallet. The seed is also sufficient for a wallet export or import, allowing for easy migration of all the keys between different wallet implementations.\n\n\nThis design makes the security of the seed of utmost importance, as only the seed is needed to gain access to the entire wallet. On the other hand, being able to focus security efforts on a single piece of data can be seen as an advantage.\n\n\n\nHierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)\n\nDeterministic wallets were developed to make it easy to derive many keys from a single seed. Currently, the most advanced form of deterministic wallet is the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet defined by Bitcoin’s BIP-32 standard. HD wallets contain keys derived in a tree structure, such that a parent key can derive a sequence of child keys, each of which can derive a sequence of grandchild keys, and so on. This tree structure is illustrated in HD wallet: a tree of keys generated from a single seed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. HD wallet: a tree of keys generated from a single seed\n\n\nHD wallets offer a few key advantages over simpler deterministic wallets. First, the tree structure can be used to express additional organizational meaning, such as when a specific branch of subkeys is used to receive incoming payments and a different branch is used to receive change from outgoing payments. Branches of keys can also be used in corporate settings, allocating different branches to departments, subsidiaries, specific functions, or accounting categories.\n\n\nThe second advantage of HD wallets is that users can create a sequence of public keys without having access to the corresponding private keys. This allows HD wallets to be used on an insecure server or in a watch-only or receive-only capacity, where the wallet doesn’t have the private keys that can spend the funds.\n\n\n\nSeeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)\n\nThere are many ways to encode a private key for secure backup and retrieval. The currently preferred method is using a sequence of words that, when taken together in the correct order, can uniquely recreate the private key. This is sometimes known as a mnemonic, and the approach has been standardized by BIP-39. Today, many Ethereum wallets (as well as wallets for other cryptocurrencies) use this standard, and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery using interoperable mnemonics.\n\n\nTo see why this approach has become popular, let’s have a look at an example:\n\n\nA seed for a deterministic wallet, in hex\n\nFCCF1AB3329FD5DA3DA9577511F8F137\n\n\n\nA seed for a deterministic wallet, from a 12-word mnemonic\n\nwolf juice proud gown wool unfair\nwall cliff insect more detail hub\n\n\n\nIn practical terms, the chance of an error when writing down the hex sequence is unacceptably high. In contrast, the list of known words is quite easy to deal with, mainly because there is a high level of redundancy in the writing of words (especially English words). If \"inzect\" had been recorded by accident, it could quickly be determined, upon the need for wallet recovery, that \"inzect\" is not a valid English word and that \"insect\" should be used instead. We are talking about writing down a representation of the seed because that is good practice when managing HD wallets: the seed is needed to recover a wallet in the case of data loss (whether through accident or theft), so keeping a backup is very prudent. However, the seed must be kept extremely private, so digital backups should be carefully avoided; hence the earlier advice to back up with pen and paper.\n\n\nIn summary, the use of a recovery word list to encode the seed for an HD wallet makes for the easiest way to safely export, transcribe, record on paper, read without error, and import a private key set into another wallet.\n\n\n\n\nWallet Best Practices\n\nAs cryptocurrency wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These standards also allow wallets to derive keys for multiple different cryptocurrencies, all from a single mnemonic. These common standards are:\n\n\n\n\nMnemonic code words, based on BIP-39\n\n\nHD wallets, based on BIP-32\n\n\nMultipurpose HD wallet structure, based on BIP-43\n\n\nMulticurrency and multiaccount wallets, based on BIP-44\n\n\n\n\nThese standards may change or be obsoleted by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for most blockchain platforms and their cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nThe standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated in one of these wallets and import it to another wallet, recovering all keys and addresses.\n\n\nSome examples of software wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically) Jaxx, MetaMask, MyCrypto, and MyEtherWallet (MEW). Examples of hardware wallets supporting these standards include Keepkey, Ledger, and Trezor.\n\n\nThe following sections examine each of these technologies in detail.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are implementing an Ethereum wallet, it should be built as an HD wallet, with a seed encoded as a mnemonic code for backup, following the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards, as described in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)\n\nMnemonic code words are word sequences that encode a random number used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words is sufficient to recreate the seed, and from there recreate the wallet and all the derived keys. A wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic words will show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet. That sequence of words is the wallet backup, and can be used to recover and recreate all the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. As we explained earlier, mnemonic word lists make it easier for users to back up wallets, because they are easy to read and correctly transcribe.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMnemonic words are often confused with \"brainwallets.\" They are not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. This important difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because humans are very poor sources of randomness. Perhaps more importantly, using the term \"brainwallet\" suggests that the words have to be memorized, which is a terrible idea, and a recipe for not having your backup when you need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMnemonic codes are defined in BIP-39. Note that BIP-39 is one implementation of a mnemonic code standard. There is a different standard, with a different set of words, used by the Electrum Bitcoin wallet and predating BIP-39. BIP-39 was proposed by the company behind the Trezor hardware wallet and is incompatible with Electrum’s implementation. However, BIP-39 has now achieved broad industry support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be considered the de facto industry standard. Furthermore, BIP-39 can be used to produce multicurrency wallets supporting Ethereum, whereas Electrum seeds cannot.\n\n\nBIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe here in nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1 through 6 are shown in Generating mnemonic words and steps 7 through 9 are shown in From mnemonic to seed.\n\n\nGenerating mnemonic words\n\nMnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the standardized process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy, adds a checksum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a cryptographically random sequence S of 128 to 256 bits.\n\n\nCreate a checksum of S by taking the first length-of-S ÷ 32 bits of the SHA-256 hash of S.\n\n\nAdd the checksum to the end of the random sequence S.\n\n\nDivide the sequence-and-checksum concatenation into sections of 11 bits.\n\n\nMap each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary of 2,048 words.\n\n\nCreate the mnemonic code from the sequence of words, maintaining the order.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating entropy and encoding as mnemonic words shows how entropy is used to generate mnemonic words.\n\n\nMnemonic codes: entropy and word length shows the relationship between the size of the entropy data and the length of mnemonic codes in words.\n\n\nTable 1. Mnemonic codes: entropy and word length\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntropy (bits)\nChecksum (bits)\nEntropy + checksum (bits)\nMnemonic length (words)\n\n\n\n\n128\n4\n132\n12\n\n\n160\n5\n165\n15\n\n\n192\n6\n198\n18\n\n\n224\n7\n231\n21\n\n\n256\n8\n264\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Generating entropy and encoding as mnemonic words\n\n\n\nFrom mnemonic to seed\n\nThe mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. The entropy is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the key-stretching function PBKDF2. The seed produced is used to build a deterministic wallet and derive its keys.\n\n\nThe key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt. The purpose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to build a lookup table enabling a brute-force attack. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has another purpose: it allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional security factor protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail in Optional passphrase in BIP-39.\n\n\nThe process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process described in the previous section:\n\n\n\n\nThe first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the mnemonic produced in step 6.\n\n\nThe second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt. The salt is composed of the string constant \"mnemonic\" concatenated with an optional user-supplied passphrase.\n\n\nPBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2,048 rounds of hashing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final output. That 512-bit value is the seed.\n\n\n\n\nFrom mnemonic to seed shows how a mnemonic is used to generate a seed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. From mnemonic to seed\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe key-stretching function, with its 2,048 rounds of hashing, is a somewhat effective protection against brute-force attacks against the mnemonic or the passphrase. It makes it costly (in computation) to try more than a few thousand passphrase and mnemonic combinations, while the number of possible derived seeds is vast (2512, or about 10154)—far bigger than the number of atoms in the visible universe (about 1080).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables #mnemonic_128_no_pass, #mnemonic_128_w_pass, and #mnemonic_256_no_pass show some examples of mnemonic codes and the seeds they produce.\n\n\nTable 2. 128-bit entropy mnemonic code, no passphrase, resulting seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntropy input (128 bits)\n0c1e24e5917779d297e14d45f14e1a1a\n\n\nMnemonic (12 words)\narmy van defense carry jealous true garbage claim echo media make crunch\n\n\nPassphrase\n(none)\n\n\nSeed  (512 bits)\n5b56c417303faa3fcba7e57400e120a0ca83ec5a4fc9ffba757fbe63fbd77a89a1a3be4c67196f57c39\na88b76373733891bfaba16ed27a813ceed498804c0570\n\n\n\n\nTable 3. 128-bit entropy mnemonic code, with passphrase, resulting seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntropy input (128 bits)\n0c1e24e5917779d297e14d45f14e1a1a\n\n\nMnemonic (12 words)\narmy van defense carry jealous true garbage claim echo media make crunch\n\n\nPassphrase\nSuperDuperSecret\n\n\nSeed  (512 bits)\n3b5df16df2157104cfdd22830162a5e170c0161653e3afe6c88defeefb0818c793dbb28ab3ab091897d0\n715861dc8a18358f80b79d49acf64142ae57037d1d54\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. 256-bit entropy mnemonic code, no passphrase, resulting seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntropy input (256 bits)\n2041546864449caff939d32d574753fe684d3c947c3346713dd8423e74abcf8c\n\n\nMnemonic (24 words)\ncake apple borrow silk endorse fitness top denial coil riot stay wolf\nluggage oxygen faint major edit measure invite love trap field dilemma oblige\n\n\nPassphrase\n(none)\n\n\nSeed (512 bits)\n3269bce2674acbd188d4f120072b13b088a0ecf87c6e4cae41657a0bb78f5315b33b3a04356e53d062e5\n5f1e0deaa082df8d487381379df848a6ad7e98798404\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional passphrase in BIP-39\n\nThe BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the derivation of the seed. If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt consisting of the constant string \"mnemonic\", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a different seed from that same mnemonic. In fact, given a single mnemonic, every possible passphrase leads to a different seed. Essentially, there is no \"wrong\" passphrase. All passphrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set of possible uninitialized wallets. The set of possible wallets is so large (2512) that there is no practical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in use, as long as the passphrase has sufficient complexity and length.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are no \"wrong\" passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optional passphrase creates two important features:\n\n\n\n\nA second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on its own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.\n\n\nA form of plausible deniability or \"duress wallet,\" where a chosen passphrase leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds, used to distract an attacker from the \"real\" wallet that contains the majority of funds.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also introduces the risk of loss:\n\n\n\n\nIf the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the passphrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are lost forever.\n\n\nConversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as the seed, it defeats the purpose of a second factor.\n\n\n\n\nWhile passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination with a carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the possibility of heirs surviving the owner being able to recover the cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nWorking with mnemonic codes\n\nBIP-39 is implemented as a library in many different programming languages. For example:\n\n\n\npython-mnemonic\n\nThe reference implementation of the standard by the SatoshiLabs team that proposed BIP-39, in Python\n\nConsenSys/eth-lightwallet\n\nLightweight JS Ethereum wallet for nodes and browser (with BIP-39)\n\nnpm/bip39\n\nJavaScript implementation of Bitcoin BIP-39: Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a BIP-39 generator implemented in a standalone web page (A BIP-39 generator as a standalone web page), which is extremely useful for testing and experimentation. The Mnemonic Code Converter generates mnemonics, seeds, and extended private keys. It can be used offline in a browser, or accessed online.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. A BIP-39 generator as a standalone web page\n\n\n\n\nCreating an HD Wallet from the Seed\n\nHD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or 512-bit random number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as detailed in the previous section.\n\n\nEvery key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root seed, which makes it possible to recreate the entire HD wallet from that seed in any compatible HD wallet. This makes it easy to export, back up, restore, and import HD wallets containing thousands or even millions of keys by transferring just the mnemonic from which the root seed is derived.\n\n\n\nHD Wallets (BIP-32) and Paths (BIP-43/44)\n\nMost HD wallets follow the BIP-32 standard, which has become a de facto industry standard for deterministic key generation.\n\n\nWe won’t be discussing all the details of BIP-32 here, only the components necessary to understand how it is used in wallets. The main important aspect is the tree-like hierarchical relationships that it is possible for the derived keys to have, as you can see in HD wallet: a tree of keys generated from a single seed. It’s also important to understand the ideas of extended keys and hardened keys, which are explained in the following sections.\n\n\nThere are dozens of interoperable implementations of BIP-32 offered in many software libraries. These are mostly designed for Bitcoin wallets, which implement addresses in a different way, but share the same key-derivation implementation as Ethereum’s BIP-32-compatible wallets. Use one designed for Ethereum, or adapt one from Bitcoin by adding an Ethereum address encoding library.\n\n\nThere is also a BIP-32 generator implemented as a standalone web page that is very useful for testing and experimentation with BIP-32.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe standalone BIP-32 generator is not an HTTPS site. That’s to remind you that the use of this tool is not secure. It is only for testing. You should not use the keys produced by this site with real funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended public and private keys\n\nIn BIP-32 terminology, keys can be \"extended.” With the right mathematical operations, these extended \"parent\" keys can be used to derive \"child\" keys, thus producing the hierarchy of keys and addresses described earlier. A parent key doesn’t have to be at the top of the tree. It can be picked out from anywhere in the tree hierarchy. Extending a key involves taking the key itself and appending a special chain code to it. A chain code is a 256-bit binary string that is mixed with each key to produce child keys.\n\n\nIf the key is a private key, it becomes an extended private key distinguished by the prefix xprv:\n\n\n\nxprv9s21ZrQH143K2JF8RafpqtKiTbsbaxEeUaMnNHsm5o6wCW3z8ySyH4UxFVSfZ8n7ESu7fgir8i...\n\n\n\nAn extended public key is distinguished by the prefix xpub:\n\n\n\nxpub661MyMwAqRbcEnKbXcCqD2GT1di5zQxVqoHPAgHNe8dv5JP8gWmDproS6kFHJnLZd23tWevhdn...\n\n\n\nA very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive child public keys from parent public keys, without having the private keys. This gives us two ways to derive a child public key: either directly from the child private key, or from the parent public key.\n\n\nAn extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure.\n\n\nThis shortcut can be used to create very secure public key–only deployments, where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key, but no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and Ethereum addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.\n\n\nOne common application of this method is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an ecommerce application. The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new Ethereum address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart), and will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of Ethereum addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the ecommerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the server doesn’t run out of keys, hence the preference to use extended public keys from HD wallets.\n\n\nAnother common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored in a hardware wallet, while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key in an offline signing Ethereum client, or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device.\n\n\n\nHardened child key derivation\n\nThe ability to derive a branch of public keys from an extended public key, or xpub, is very useful, but it comes with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child private keys. However, because the xpub contains the chain code (used to derive child public keys from the parent public key), if a child private key is known, or somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other child private keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.\n\n\nTo counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key.\n\n\nIn simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, you should derive it from a hardened parent, rather than a normal parent. Best practice is to have the level-1 children of the master keys always derived by hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys.\n\n\n\nIndex numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n\nIt is clearly desirable to be able to derive more than one child key from a given parent key. To manage this, an index number is used. Each index number, when combined with a parent key using the special child derivation function, gives a different child key. The index number used in the BIP-32 parent-to-child derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal (unhardened) derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. Index numbers between 0 and 231–1 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between 231 and 232–1 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation. Therefore, if the index number is less than 231, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal to or above 231, the child is hardened.\n\n\nTo make the index numbers easier to read and display, the index numbers for hardened children are displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence, then, the second hardened key would have index of 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means 231 + i.\n\n\n\nHD wallet key identifier (path)\n\nKeys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with m. Public keys derived from the master public key start with M. Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n\n\nThe \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived. For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the key that is the z-th child of key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of key m/x, which is the x-th child of m.\n\n\nTable 5. HD wallet path examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHD path\nKey described\n\n\n\n\nm/0\nThe first (0) child private key of the master private key (m)\n\n\nm/0/0\nThe first grandchild private key of the first child (m/0)\n\n\nm/0'/0\nThe first normal grandchild of the first hardened child (m/0')\n\n\nm/1/0\nThe first grandchild private key of the second child (m/1)\n\n\nM/23/17/0/0\nThe first great-great-grandchild public key of the first great-grandchild of the 18th grandchild of the 24th child\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating the HD wallet tree structure\n\nThe HD wallet tree structure is tremendously flexible. The flip side of this is that it also allows for unbounded complexity: each parent extended key can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion hardened children. Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The tree can be as deep as you want, with a potentially infinite number of generations. With all that potential, it can become quite difficult to navigate these very large trees.\n\n\nTwo BIPs offer a way to manage this potential complexity by creating standards for the structure of HD wallet trees. BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number defining the purpose of the wallet by identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree. More specifically, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/... is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number i.\n\n\nExtending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multicurrency multiaccount structure signified by setting the \"purpose\" number to 44'. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only use one branch of the tree: m/44'/*.\n\n\nBIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree levels:\n\n\n\nm / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index\n\n\n\nThe first level, purpose&#x27;, is always set to 44&#x27;. The second level, coin_type&#x27;, specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are several currencies defined in a standards document called SLIP0044; for example, Ethereum is m/44&#x27;/60&#x27;, Ethereum Classic is m/44&#x27;/61&#x27;, Bitcoin is m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;, and Testnet for all currencies is m/44&#x27;/1&#x27;.\n\n\nThe third level of the tree is account&#x27;, which allows users to subdivide their wallets into separate logical subaccounts for accounting or organizational purposes. For example, an HD wallet might contain two Ethereum \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/60&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/60&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree.\n\n\nBecause BIP-44 was created originally for Bitcoin, it contains a \"quirk\" that isn’t relevant in the Ethereum world. On the fourth level of the path, change, an HD wallet has two subtrees: one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses. Only the \"receive\" path is used in Ethereum, as there is no necessity for a change address like there is in Bitcoin. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow the account level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment. Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the fifth level of the tree the address_index. For example, the third receiving address for Ethereum payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/60&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2.

They allow users to manage collections of keys and addresses. Wallets also allow users to demonstrate their ownership of ether, and authorize transactions, by applying digital signatures, as we will see in [tx_chapter].\n\n\n\n"},"06transactions.html":{"url":"06transactions.html","title":"Chapter 6: Transactions","keywords":"","body":"\nTransactions\n\n\nTransactions are signed messages originated by an externally owned account, transmitted by the Ethereum network, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This basic definition conceals a lot of surprising and fascinating details. Another way to look at transactions is that they are the only things that can trigger a change of state, or cause a contract to execute in the EVM. Ethereum is a global singleton state machine, and transactions are what make that state machine \"tick,\" changing its state. Contracts don’t run on their own. Ethereum doesn’t run  autonomously. Everything starts with a transaction.\n\n\nIn this chapter, we will dissect transactions, show how they work, and examine the details. Note that much of this chapter is addressed to those who are interested in managing their own transactions at a low level, perhaps because they are writing a wallet app; you don’t have to worry about this if you are happy using existing wallet applications, although you may find the details interesting!\n\n\nThe Structure of a Transaction\n\nFirst let’s take a look at the basic structure of a transaction, as it is serialized and transmitted on the Ethereum network. Each client and application that receives a serialized transaction will store it in-memory using its own internal data structure, perhaps embellished with metadata that doesn’t exist in the network serialized transaction itself. The network-serialization is the only standard form of a transaction.\n\n\nA transaction is a serialized binary message that contains the following data:\n\n\n\nNonce\n\nA sequence number, issued by the originating EOA, used to prevent message replay\n\nGas price\n\nThe price of gas (in wei) the originator is willing to pay\n\nGas limit\n\nThe maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to buy for this transaction\n\nRecipient\n\nThe destination Ethereum address\n\nValue\n\nThe amount of ether to send to the destination\n\nData\n\nThe variable-length binary data payload\n\nv,r,s\n\nThe three components of an ECDSA digital signature of the originating EOA\n\n\n\n\nThe transaction message’s structure is serialized using the Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding scheme, which was created specifically for simple, byte-perfect data serialization in Ethereum. All numbers in Ethereum are encoded as big-endian integers, of lengths that are multiples of 8 bits.\n\n\nNote that the field labels (to, gas limit, etc.) are shown here for clarity, but are not part of the transaction serialized data, which contains the field values RLP-encoded. In general, RLP does not contain any field delimiters or labels. RLP’s length prefix is used to identify the length of each field. Anything beyond the defined length belongs to the next field in the structure.\n\n\nWhile this is the actual transaction structure transmitted, most internal representations and user interface visualizations embellish this with additional information, derived from the transaction or from the blockchain.\n\n\nFor example, you may notice there is no “from” data in the address identifying the originator EOA. That is because the EOA’s public key can be derived from the v,r,s components of the ECDSA signature. The address can, in turn, be derived from the public key. When you see a transaction showing a \"from\" field, that was added by the software used to visualize the transaction. Other metadata frequently added to the transaction by client software includes the block number (once it is mined and included in the blockchain) and a transaction ID (calculated hash). Again, this data is derived from the transaction, and does not form part of the transaction message itself.\n\n\n\nThe Transaction Nonce\n\nThe nonce is one of the most important and least understood components of a transaction. The definition in the Yellow Paper (see [references]) reads:\n\n\n\n\nnonce: A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account.\n\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the nonce is an attribute of the originating address; that is, it only has meaning in the context of the sending address. However, the nonce is not stored explicitly as part of an account’s state on the blockchain. Instead, it is calculated dynamically, by counting the number of confirmed transactions that have originated from an address.\n\n\nThere are two scenarios where the existence of a transaction-counting nonce is important: the usability feature of transactions being included in the order of creation, and the vital feature of transaction duplication protection. Let’s look at an example scenario for each of these:\n\n\n\n\nImagine you wish to make two transactions. You have an important payment to make of 6 ether, and also another payment of 8 ether. You sign and broadcast the 6-ether transaction first, because it is the more important one, and then you sign and broadcast the second, 8-ether transaction. Sadly, you have overlooked the fact that your account contains only 10 ether, so the network can’t accept both transactions: one of them will fail. Because you sent the more important 6-ether one first, you understandably expect that one to go through and the 8-ether one to be rejected. However, in a decentralized system like Ethereum, nodes may receive the transactions in either order; there is no guarantee that a particular node will have one transaction propagated to it before the other. As such, it will almost certainly be the case that some nodes receive the 6-ether transaction first and others receive the 8-ether transaction first. Without the nonce, it would be random as to which one gets accepted and which rejected. However, with the nonce included, the first transaction you sent will have a nonce of, let’s say, 3, while the 8-ether transaction has the next nonce value (i.e., 4). So, that transaction will be ignored until the transactions with nonces from 0 to 3 have been processed, even if it is received first. Phew!\n\n\nNow imagine you have an account with 100 ether. Fantastic! You find someone online who will accept payment in ether for a mcguffin-widget that you really want to buy. You send them 2 ether and they send you the mcguffin-widget. Lovely. To make that 2-ether payment, you signed a transaction sending 2 ether from your account to their account, and then broadcast it to the Ethereum network to be verified and included on the blockchain. Now, without a nonce value in the transaction, a second transaction sending 2 ether to the same address a second time will look exactly the same as the first transaction. This means that anyone who sees your transaction on the Ethereum network (which means everyone, including the recipient or your enemies) can \"replay\" the transaction again and again and again until all your ether is gone simply by copying and pasting your original transaction and resending it to the network. However, with the nonce value included in the transaction data, every single transaction is unique, even when sending the same amount of ether to the same recipient address multiple times. Thus, by having the incrementing nonce as part of the transaction, it is simply not possible for anyone to \"duplicate\" a payment you have made.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, it is important to note that the use of the nonce is actually vital for an account-based protocol, in contrast to the “Unspent Transaction Output” (UTXO) mechanism of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n\nKeeping Track of Nonces\n\nIn practical terms, the nonce is an up-to-date count of the number of confirmed (i.e., on-chain) transactions that have originated from an account. To find out what the nonce is, you can interrogate the blockchain, for example via the web3 interface. Open a JavaScript console in a browser with MetaMask running, or use the truffle console command to access the JavaScript web3 library, then type:\n\n\n> web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\")\n40\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe nonce is a zero-based counter, meaning the first transaction has nonce 0. In this example, we have a transaction count of 40, meaning nonces 0 through 39 have been seen. The next transaction’s nonce will need to be 40.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour wallet will keep track of nonces for each address it manages. It’s fairly simple to do that, as long as you are only originating transactions from a single point. Let’s say you are writing your own wallet software or some other application that originates transactions. How do you track nonces?\n\n\nWhen you create a new transaction, you assign the next nonce in the sequence. But until it is confirmed, it will not count toward the getTransactionCount total.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe careful when using the getTransactionCount function for counting pending transactions, because you might run into some problems if you send a few transactions in a row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at an example:\n\n\n> web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\", \\\n\"pending\")\n40\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \\\n\"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34\", value: web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\")});\n> web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\", \\\n\"pending\")\n41\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \\\n\"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34\", value: web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\")});\n> web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\", \\\n\"pending\")\n41\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \\\n\"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34\", value: web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\")});\n> web3.eth.getTransactionCount(\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\", \\\n\"pending\")\n41\n\n\nAs you can see, the first transaction we sent increased the transaction count to 41, showing the pending transaction. But when we sent three more transactions in quick succession, the getTransactionCount call didn’t count them. It only counted one, even though you might expect there to be three pending in the mempool. If we wait a few seconds to allow for network communications to settle down, the getTransactionCount call will return the expected number. But in the interim, while there is more than one transaction pending, it might not help us.\n\n\nWhen you build an application that constructs transactions, it cannot rely on getTransactionCount for pending transactions. Only when the pending and confirmed counts are equal (all outstanding transactions are confirmed) can you trust the output of getTransactionCount to start your nonce counter. Thereafter, keep track of the nonce in your application until each transaction confirms.\n\n\nParity’s JSON RPC interface offers the parity_nextNonce function, which returns the next nonce that should be used in a transaction. The parity_nextNonce function counts nonces correctly, even if you construct several transactions in rapid succession without confirming them:\n\n\n$ curl --data '{\"method\":\"parity_nextNonce\", \\\n  \"params\":[\"0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f\"],\\\n  \"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \\\n  localhost:8545\n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"0x32\",\"id\":1}\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nParity has a web console for accessing the JSON RPC interface, but here we are using a command-line HTTP client to access it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaps in Nonces, Duplicate Nonces, and Confirmation\n\nIt is important to keep track of nonces if you are creating transactions programmatically, especially if you are doing so from multiple independent processes simultaneously.\n\n\nThe Ethereum network processes transactions sequentially, based on the nonce. That means that if you transmit a transaction with nonce 0 and then transmit a transaction with nonce 2, the second transaction will not be included in any blocks. It will be stored in the mempool, while the Ethereum network waits for the missing nonce to appear. All nodes will assume that the missing nonce has simply been delayed and that the transaction with nonce 2 was received out of sequence.\n\n\nIf you then transmit a transaction with the missing nonce 1, both transactions (nonces 1 and 2) will be processed and included (if valid, of course). Once you fill the gap, the network can mine the out-of-sequence transaction that it held in the mempool.\n\n\nWhat this means is that if you create several transactions in sequence and one of them does not get officially included in any blocks, all the subsequent transactions will be \"stuck,\" waiting for the missing nonce. A transaction can create an inadvertent \"gap\" in the nonce sequence because it is invalid or has insufficient gas. To get things moving again, you have to transmit a valid transaction with the missing nonce. You should be equally mindful that once a transaction with the \"missing\" nonce is validated by the network, all the broadcast transactions with subsequent nonces will incrementally become valid; it is not possible to \"recall\" a transaction!\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, you accidentally duplicate a nonce, for example by transmitting two transactions with the same nonce but different recipients or values, then one of them will be confirmed and one will be rejected. Which one is confirmed will be determined by the sequence in which they arrive at the first validating node that receives them—i.e., it will be fairly random.\n\n\nAs you can see, keeping track of nonces is necessary, and if your application doesn’t manage that process correctly you will run into problems. Unfortunately, things get even more difficult if you are trying to do this concurrently, as we will see in the next section.\n\n\n\nConcurrency, Transaction Origination, and Nonces\n\nConcurrency is a complex aspect of computer science, and it crops up unexpectedly sometimes, especially in decentralized and distributed real-time systems like Ethereum.\n\n\nIn simple terms, concurrency is when you have simultaneous computation by multiple independent systems. These can be in the same program (e.g., multithreading), on the same CPU (e.g., multiprocessing), or on different computers (i.e., distributed systems). Ethereum, by definition, is a system that allows concurrency of operations (nodes, clients, DApps) but enforces a singleton state through consensus.\n\n\nNow, imagine that you have multiple independent wallet applications that are generating transactions from the same address or addresses. One example of such a situation would be an exchange processing withdrawals from the exchange’s hot wallet (a wallet whose keys are stored online, in contrast to a cold wallet where the keys are never online). Ideally, you’d want to have more than one computer processing withdrawals, so that it doesn’t become a bottleneck or single point of failure. However, this quickly becomes problematic, as having more than one computer producing withdrawals will result in some thorny concurrency problems, not least of which is the selection of nonces. How do multiple computers generating, signing, and broadcasting transactions from the same hot wallet account coordinate?\n\n\nYou could use a single computer to assign nonces, on a first-come first-served basis, to computers signing transactions. However, this computer is now a single point of failure. Worse, if several nonces are assigned and one of them never gets used (because of a failure in the computer processing the transaction with that nonce), all subsequent transactions get stuck.\n\n\nAnother approach would be to generate the transactions, but not assign a nonce to them (and therefore leave them unsigned—remember that the nonce is an integral part of the transaction data and therefore needs to be included in the digital signature that authenticates the transaction). You could then queue them to a single node that signs them and also keeps track of nonces. Again, though, this would be a choke point in the process: the signing and tracking of nonces is the part of your operation that is likely to become congested under load, whereas the generation of the unsigned transaction is the part you don’t really need to parallelize. You would have some concurrency, but it would be lacking in a critical part of the process.\n\n\nIn the end, these concurrency problems, on top of the difficulty of tracking account balances and transaction confirmations in independent processes, force most implementations toward avoiding concurrency and creating bottlenecks such as a single process handling all withdrawal transactions in an exchange, or setting up multiple hot wallets that can work completely independently for withdrawals and only need to be intermittently rebalanced.\n\n\n\n\nTransaction Gas\n\nWe talked about gas a little in earlier chapters, and we discuss it in more detail in [gas]. However, let’s cover some basics about the role of the gasPrice and gasLimit components of a transaction.\n\n\nGas is the fuel of Ethereum. Gas is not ether—it’s a separate virtual currency with its own exchange rate against ether. Ethereum uses gas to control the amount of resources that a transaction can use, since it will be processed on thousands of computers around the world. The open-ended (Turing-complete) computation model requires some form of metering in order to avoid denial-of-service attacks or inadvertently resource-devouring transactions.\n\n\nGas is separate from ether in order to protect the system from the volatility that might arise along with rapid changes in the value of ether, and also as a way to manage the important and sensitive ratios between the costs of the various resources that gas pays for (namely, computation, memory, and storage).\n\n\nThe gasPrice field in a transaction allows the transaction originator to set the price they are willing to pay in exchange for gas. The price is measured in wei per gas unit. For example, in the sample transaction in [intro_chapter] your wallet set the gasPrice to 3 gwei (3 gigawei or 3 billion wei).\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe popular site ETH Gas Station provides information on the current prices of gas and other relevant gas metrics for the Ethereum main network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallets can adjust the gasPrice in transactions they originate to achieve faster confirmation of transactions. The higher the gasPrice, the faster the transaction is likely to be confirmed. Conversely, lower-priority transactions can carry a reduced price, resulting in slower confirmation. The minimum value that gasPrice can be set to is zero, which means a fee-free transaction. During periods of low demand for space in a block, such transactions might very well get mined.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe minimum acceptable gasPrice is zero. That means that wallets can generate completely free transactions. Depending on capacity, these may never be confirmed, but there is nothing in the protocol that prohibits free transactions. You can find several examples of such transactions successfully included on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe web3 interface offers a gasPrice suggestion, by calculating a median price across several blocks (we can use the truffle console or any JavaScript web3 console to do that):\n\n\n> web3.eth.getGasPrice(console.log)\n> null BigNumber { s: 1, e: 10, c: [ 10000000000 ] }\n\n\nThe second important field related to gas is gasLimit. In simple terms, gasLimit gives the maximum number of units of gas the transaction originator is willing to buy in order to complete the transaction. For simple payments, meaning transactions that transfer ether from one EOA to another EOA, the gas amount needed is fixed at 21,000 gas units. To calculate how much ether that will cost, you multiply 21,000 by the gasPrice you’re willing to pay. For example:\n\n\n> web3.eth.getGasPrice(function(err, res) {console.log(res*21000)} )\n> 210000000000000\n\n\nIf your transaction’s destination address is a contract, then the amount of gas needed can be estimated but cannot be determined with accuracy. That’s because a contract can evaluate different conditions that lead to different execution paths, with different total gas costs. The contract may execute only a simple computation or a more complex one, depending on conditions that are outside of your control and cannot be predicted. To demonstrate this, let’s look at an example: we can write a smart contract that increments a counter each time it is called and executes a particular loop a number of times equal to the call count. Maybe on the 100th call it gives out a special prize, like a lottery, but needs to do additional computation to calculate the prize. If you call the contract 99 times one thing happens, but on the 100th call something very different happens. The amount of gas you would pay for that depends on how many other transactions have called that function before your transaction is included in a block. Perhaps your estimate is based on being the 99th transaction, but just before your transaction is confirmed someone else calls the contract for the 99th time. Now you’re the 100th transaction to call, and the computation effort (and gas cost) is much higher.\n\n\nTo borrow a common analogy used in Ethereum, you can think of gasLimit as the capacity of the fuel tank in your car (your car is the transaction). You fill the tank with as much gas as you think it will need for the journey (the computation needed to validate your transaction). You can estimate the amount to some degree, but there might be unexpected changes to your journey, such as a diversion (a more complex execution path), that increase fuel consumption.\n\n\nThe analogy to a fuel tank is somewhat misleading, however. It’s actually more like a credit account for a gas station company, where you pay after the trip is completed, based on how much gas you actually used. When you transmit your transaction, one of the first validation steps is to check that the account it originated from has enough ether to pay the gasPrice * gas fee. But the amount is not actually deducted from your account until the transaction finishes executing. You are only billed for gas actually consumed by your transaction, but you have to have enough balance for the maximum amount you are willing to pay before you send your transaction.\n\n\n\nTransaction Recipient\n\nThe recipient of a transaction is specified in the to field. This contains a 20-byte Ethereum address. The address can be an EOA or a contract address.\n\n\nEthereum does no further validation of this field. Any 20-byte value is considered valid. If the 20-byte value corresponds to an address without a corresponding private key, or without a corresponding contract, the transaction is still valid. Ethereum has no way of knowing whether an address was correctly derived from a public key (and therefore from a private key) in existence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum protocol does not validate recipient addresses in transactions. You can send to an address that has no corresponding private key or contract, thereby \"burning\" the ether, rendering it forever unspendable. Validation should be done at the user interface level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending a transaction to the wrong address will probably burn the ether sent, rendering it forever inaccessible (unspendable), since most addresses do not have a known private key and therefore no signature can be generated to spend it. It is assumed that validation of the address happens at the user interface level (see [EIP55]). In fact, there are a number of valid reasons for burning ether—for example, as a disincentive to cheating in payment channels and other smart contracts—and since the amount of ether is finite, burning ether effectively distributes the value burned to all ether holders (in proportion to the amount of ether they hold).\n\n\n\nTransaction Value and Data\n\nThe main \"payload\" of a transaction is contained in two fields: value and data. Transactions can have both value and data, only value, only data, or neither value nor data. All four combinations are valid.\n\n\nA transaction with only value is a payment. A transaction with only data is an invocation. A transaction with both value and data is both a payment and an invocation. A transaction with neither value nor data—well that’s probably just a waste of gas! But it is still possible.\n\n\nLet’s try all of these combinations. First we’ll set the source and destination addresses from our wallet, just to make the demo easier to read:\n\n\n\nsrc = web3.eth.accounts[0];\ndst = web3.eth.accounts[1];\n\n\n\nOur first transaction contains only a value (payment), and no data payload:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: dst, \\\n  value: web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\"), data: \"\"});\n\n\n\nOur wallet shows a confirmation screen indicating the value to send, as shown in Parity wallet showing a transaction with value, but no data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Parity wallet showing a transaction with value, but no data\n\n\nThe next example specifies both a value and a data payload:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: dst, \\\n  value: web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\"), data: \"0x1234\"});\n\n\n\nOur wallet shows a confirmation screen indicating the value to send as well as the data payload, as shown in Parity wallet showing a transaction with value and data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Parity wallet showing a transaction with value and data\n\n\nThe next transaction includes a data payload but specifies a value of zero:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: dst, value: 0, data: \"0x1234\"});\n\n\n\nOur wallet shows a confirmation screen indicating the zero value and the data payload, as shown in Parity wallet showing a transaction with no value, only data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Parity wallet showing a transaction with no value, only data\n\n\nFinally, the last transaction includes neither a value to send nor a data payload:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: dst, value: 0, data: \"\"}));\n\n\n\nOur wallet shows a confirmation screen indicating zero value, as shown in Parity wallet showing a transaction with no value, and no data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Parity wallet showing a transaction with no value, and no data\n\n\nTransmitting Value to EOAs and Contracts\n\nWhen you construct an Ethereum transaction that contains a value, it is the equivalent of a payment. Such transactions behave differently depending on whether the destination address is a contract or not.\n\n\nFor EOA addresses, or rather for any address that isn’t flagged as a contract on the blockchain, Ethereum will record a state change, adding the value you sent to the balance of the address. If the address has not been seen before, it will be added to the client’s internal representation of the state and its balance initialized to the value of your payment.\n\n\nIf the destination address (to) is a contract, then the EVM will execute the contract and will attempt to call the function named in the data payload of your transaction. If there is no data in your transaction, the EVM will call a fallback function and, if that function is payable, will execute it to determine what to do next. If there is no fallback function, then the effect of the transaction will be to increase the balance of the contract, exactly like a payment to a wallet.\n\n\nA contract can reject incoming payments by throwing an exception immediately when a function is called, or as determined by conditions coded in a function. If the function terminates successfully (without an exception), then the contract’s state is updated to reflect an increase in the contract’s ether balance.\n\n\n\nTransmitting a Data Payload to an EOA or Contract\n\nWhen your transaction contains data, it is most likely addressed to a contract address. That doesn’t mean you cannot send a data payload to an EOA—that is completely valid in the Ethereum protocol. However, in that case, the interpretation of the data is up to the wallet you use to access the EOA. It is ignored by the Ethereum protocol. Most wallets also ignore any data received in a transaction to an EOA they control. In the future, it is possible that standards may emerge that allow wallets to interpret data the way contracts do, thereby allowing transactions to invoke functions running inside user wallets. The critical difference is that any interpretation of the data payload by an EOA is not subject to Ethereum’s consensus rules, unlike a contract execution.\n\n\nFor now, let’s assume your transaction is delivering data to a contract address. In that case, the data will be interpreted by the EVM as a contract invocation. Most contracts use this data more specifically as a function invocation, calling the named function and passing any encoded arguments to the function.\n\n\nThe data payload sent to an ABI-compatible contract (which you can assume all contracts are) is a hex-serialized encoding of:\n\n\n\nA function selector\n\nThe first 4 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the function’s prototype. This allows the contract to unambiguously identify which function you wish to invoke.\n\nThe function arguments\n\nThe function’s arguments, encoded according to the rules for the various elementary types defined in the ABI specification.\n\n\n\n\nIn [solidity_faucet_example], we defined a function for withdrawals:\n\n\n\nfunction withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n\n\n\nThe prototype of a function is defined as the string containing the name of the function, followed by the data types of each of its arguments, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. The function name here is withdraw and it takes a single argument that is a uint (which is an alias for uint256), so the prototype of withdraw would be:\n\n\n\nwithdraw(uint256)\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate the Keccak-256 hash of this string:\n\n\n> web3.sha3(\"withdraw(uint256)\");\n'0x2e1a7d4d13322e7b96f9a57413e1525c250fb7a9021cf91d1540d5b69f16a49f'\n\n\nThe first 4 bytes of the hash are 0x2e1a7d4d. That’s our \"function selector\" value, which will tell the contract which function we want to call.\n\n\nNext, let’s calculate a value to pass as the argument withdraw_amount. We want to withdraw 0.01 ether. Let’s encode that to a hex-serialized big-endian unsigned 256-bit integer, denominated in wei:\n\n\n> withdraw_amount = web3.toWei(0.01, \"ether\");\n'10000000000000000'\n> withdraw_amount_hex = web3.toHex(withdraw_amount);\n'0x2386f26fc10000'\n\n\nNow, we add the function selector to the amount (padded to 32 bytes):\n\n\n\n2e1a7d4d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000\n\n\n\nThat’s the data payload for our transaction, invoking the withdraw function and requesting 0.01 ether as the withdraw_amount.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Transaction: Contract Creation\n\nOne special case that we should mention is a transaction that creates a new contract on the blockchain, deploying it for future use. Contract creation transactions are sent to a special destination address called the zero address; the to field in a contract registration transaction contains the address 0x0. This address represents neither an EOA (there is no corresponding private–public key pair) nor a contract. It can never spend ether or initiate a transaction. It is only used as a destination, with the special meaning \"create this contract.\"\n\n\nWhile the zero address is intended only for contract creation, it sometimes receives payments from various addresses. There are two explanations for this: either it is by accident, resulting in the loss of ether, or it is an intentional ether burn (deliberately destroying ether by sending it to an address from which it can never be spent). However, if you want to do an intentional ether burn, you should make your intention clear to the network and use the specially designated burn address instead:\n\n\n\n0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAny ether sent to the designated burn address will become unspendable and be lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA contract creation transaction need only contain a data payload that contains the compiled bytecode which will create the contract. The only effect of this transaction is to create the contract. You can include an ether amount in the value field if you want to set the new contract up with a starting balance, but that is entirely optional. If you send a value (ether) to the contract creation address without a data payload (no contract), then the effect is the same as sending to a burn address—there is no contract to credit, so the ether is lost.\n\n\nAs an example, we can create the Faucet.sol contract used in [intro_chapter] by manually creating a transaction to the zero address with the contract in the data payload. The contract needs to be compiled into a bytecode representation. This can be done with the Solidity compiler:\n\n\n$ solc --bin Faucet.sol\n\nBinary:\n6060604052341561000f57600080fd5b60e58061001d6000396000f30060606040526004361060...\n\n\nThe same information can also be obtained from the Remix online compiler.\n\n\nNow we can create the transaction:\n\n\n> src = web3.eth.accounts[0];\n> faucet_code = \\\n  \"0x6060604052341561000f57600080fd5b60e58061001d6000396000f300606...f0029\";\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: 0, data: faucet_code, \\\n  gas: 113558, gasPrice: 200000000000});\n\n\"0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b\"\n\n\nIt is good practice to always specify a to parameter, even in the case of zero-address contract creation, because the cost of accidentally sending your ether to 0x0 and losing it forever is too great. You should also specify a gasPrice and gasLimit.\n\n\nOnce the contract is mined we can see it on the Etherscan block explorer, as shown in Etherscan showing the contract successfully mined.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Etherscan showing the contract successfully mined\n\n\nWe can look at the receipt of the transaction to get information about the contract:\n\n\n> eth.getTransactionReceipt( \\\n  \"0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b\");\n\n{\n  blockHash: \"0x6fa7d8bf982490de6246875deb2c21e5f3665b4422089c060138fc3907a95bb2\",\n  blockNumber: 3105256,\n  contractAddress: \"0xb226270965b43373e98ffc6e2c7693c17e2cf40b\",\n  cumulativeGasUsed: 113558,\n  from: \"0x2a966a87db5913c1b22a59b0d8a11cc51c167a89\",\n  gasUsed: 113558,\n  logs: [],\n  logsBloom: \\\n    \"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...00000\",\n  status: \"0x1\",\n  to: null,\n  transactionHash: \\\n    \"0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b\",\n  transactionIndex: 0\n}\n\n\nThis includes the address of the contract, which we can use to send funds to and receive funds from the contract as shown in the previous section:\n\n\n> contract_address = \"0xb226270965b43373e98ffc6e2c7693c17e2cf40b\"\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: contract_address, \\\n  value: web3.toWei(0.1, \"ether\"), data: \"\"});\n\n\"0x6ebf2e1fe95cc9c1fe2e1a0dc45678ccd127d374fdf145c5c8e6cd4ea2e6ca9f\"\n\n> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: contract_address, value: 0, data: \\\n  \"0x2e1a7d4d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000\"});\n\n\"0x59836029e7ce43e92daf84313816ca31420a76a9a571b69e31ec4bf4b37cd16e\"\n\n\nAfter a while, both transactions are visible on Etherscan, as shown in Etherscan showing the transactions for sending and receiving funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Etherscan showing the transactions for sending and receiving funds\n\n\n\nDigital Signatures\n\nSo far, we have not delved into any detail about digital signatures. In this section, we look at how digital signatures work and how they can be used to present proof of ownership of a private key without revealing that private key.\n\n\nThe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\n\nThe digital signature algorithm used in Ethereum is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). It’s based on elliptic curve private–public key pairs, as described in [elliptic_curve].\n\n\nA digital signature serves three purposes in Ethereum (see the following sidebar). First, the signature proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of an Ethereum account, has authorized the spending of ether, or execution of a contract. Secondly, it guarantees non-repudiation: the proof of authorization is undeniable. Thirdly, the signature proves that the transaction data has not been and cannot be modified by anyone after the transaction has been signed.\n\n\n\nWikipedia’s Definition of a Digital Signature\n\nA digital signature is a mathematical scheme for presenting the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Digital Signatures Work\n\nA digital signature is a mathematical scheme that consists of two parts. The first part is an algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key (the signing key), from a message (which in our case is the transaction). The second part is an algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature by only using the message and a public key.\n\n\nCreating a digital signature\n\nIn Ethereum’s implementation of ECDSA, the \"message\" being signed is the transaction, or more accurately, the Keccak-256 hash of the RLP-encoded data from the transaction. The signing key is the EOA’s private key. The result is the signature:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      S\n      i\n      g\n    \n    =\n    F sig \n    \n      (\n      F keccak256 \n      \n        (\n        m\n        )\n      \n      ,\n      k\n      )\n    \n  \n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nk is the signing private key.\n\n\nm is the RLP-encoded transaction.\n\n\nFkeccak256 is the Keccak-256 hash function.\n\n\nFsig is the signing algorithm.\n\n\nSig is the resulting signature.\n\n\n\n\nThe function Fsig produces a signature Sig that is composed of two values, commonly referred to as r and s:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      S\n      i\n      g\n    \n    =\n    (\n    r\n    ,\n    s\n    )\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nVerifying the Signature\n\nTo verify the signature, one must have the signature (r and s), the serialized transaction, and the public key that corresponds to the private key used to create the signature. Essentially, verification of a signature means \"only the owner of the private key that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this transaction.\"\n\n\nThe signature verification algorithm takes the message (i.e., a hash of the transaction for our usage), the signer’s public key, and the signature (r and s values), and returns true if the signature is valid for this message and public key.\n\n\n\nECDSA Math\n\nAs mentioned previously, signatures are created by a mathematical function Fsig that produces a signature composed of two values, r and s. In this section we look at the function Fsig in more detail.\n\n\nThe signature algorithm first generates an ephemeral (temporary) private key in a cryptographically secure way. This temporary key is used in the calculation of the r and s values to ensure that the sender’s actual private key can’t be calculated by attackers watching signed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\n\nAs we know from [pubkey], the ephemeral private key is used to derive the corresponding (ephemeral) public key, so we have:\n\n\n\n\nA cryptographically secure random number q, which is used as the ephemeral private key\n\n\nThe corresponding ephemeral public key Q, generated from q and the elliptic curve generator point G\n\n\n\n\nThe r value of the digital signature is then the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key Q.\n\n\nFrom there, the algorithm calculates the s value of the signature, such that:\n\n\ns ≡ q-1 (Keccak256(m) + r * k)       (mod p)\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nq is the ephemeral private key.\n\n\nr is the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key.\n\n\nk is the signing (EOA owner’s) private key.\n\n\nm is the transaction data.\n\n\np is the prime order of the elliptic curve.\n\n\n\n\nVerification is the inverse of the signature generation function, using the r and s values and the sender’s public key to calculate a value Q, which is a point on the elliptic curve (the ephemeral public key used in signature creation). The steps are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCheck all inputs are correctly formed\n\n\nCalculate w = s-1 mod p\n\n\nCalculate u1 = Keccak256(m) * w mod p\n\n\nCalculate u2 = r * w mod p\n\n\nFinally, calculate the point on the elliptic curve Q ≡ u1 * _G + u2 * K      (mod p)\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nr and s are the signature values.\n\n\nK is the signer’s (EOA owner’s) public key.\n\n\nm is the transaction data that was signed.\n\n\nG is the elliptic curve generator point.\n\n\np is the prime order of the elliptic curve.\n\n\n\n\nIf the x coordinate of the calculated point Q is equal to r, then the verifier can conclude that the signature is valid.\n\n\nNote that in verifying the signature, the private key is neither known nor revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nECDSA is necessarily a fairly complicated piece of math; a full explanation is beyond the scope of this book. A number of great guides online take you through it step by step: search for \"ECDSA explained\" or try this one: http://bit.ly/2r0HhGB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction Signing in Practice\n\nTo produce a valid transaction, the originator must digitally sign the message, using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. When we say \"sign the transaction\" we actually mean \"sign the Keccak-256 hash of the RLP-serialized transaction data.\" The signature is applied to the hash of the transaction data, not the transaction itself.\n\n\nTo sign a transaction in Ethereum, the originator must:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a transaction data structure, containing nine fields: nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, chainID, 0, 0.\n\n\nProduce an RLP-encoded serialized message of the transaction data structure.\n\n\nCompute the Keccak-256 hash of this serialized message.\n\n\nCompute the ECDSA signature, signing the hash with the originating EOA’s private key.\n\n\nAppend the ECDSA signature’s computed v, r, and s values to the transaction.\n\n\n\n\nThe special signature variable v indicates two things: the chain ID and the recovery identifier to help the ECDSArecover function check the signature. It is calculated as either one of 27 or 28, or as the chain ID doubled plus 35 or 36. For more information on the chain ID, see Raw Transaction Creation with EIP-155. The recovery identifier (27 or 28 in the \"old-style\" signatures, or 35 or 36 in the full Spurious Dragon–style transactions) is used to indicate the parity of the y component of the public key (see The Signature Prefix Value (v) and Public Key Recovery for more details).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt block #2,675,000 Ethereum implemented the \"Spurious Dragon\" hard fork, which, among other changes, introduced a new signing scheme that includes transaction replay protection (preventing transactions meant for one network being replayed on others). This new signing scheme is specified in EIP-155. This change affects the form of the transaction and its signature, so attention must be paid to the first of the three signature variables (i.e., v), which takes one of two forms and indicates the data fields included in the transaction message being hashed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Transaction Creation and Signing\n\nIn this section we’ll create a raw transaction and sign it, using the ethereumjs-tx library. This demonstrates the functions that would normally be used inside a wallet, or an application that signs transactions on behalf of a user. The source code for this example is in the file raw_tx_demo.js in the book’s GitHub repository:\n\n\n\nlink:code/web3js/raw_tx/raw_tx_demo.js[]\n\n\n\nRunning the example code produces the following results:\n\n\n$ node raw_tx_demo.js\nRLP-Encoded Tx: 0xe6808609184e72a0008303000094b0920c523d582040f2bcb1bd7fb1c7c1...\nTx Hash: 0xaa7f03f9f4e52fcf69f836a6d2bbc7706580adce0a068ff6525ba337218e6992\nSigned Raw Transaction: 0xf866808609184e72a0008303000094b0920c523d582040f2bcb1...\n\n\n\nRaw Transaction Creation with EIP-155\n\nThe EIP-155 \"Simple Replay Attack Protection\" standard specifies a replay-attack-protected transaction encoding, which includes a chain identifier inside the transaction data, prior to signing. This ensures that transactions created for one blockchain (e.g., the Ethereum main network) are invalid on another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum Classic or the Ropsten test network). Therefore, transactions broadcast on one network cannot be replayed on another, hence the name of the standard.\n\n\nEIP-155 adds three fields to the main six fields of the transaction data structure, namely the chain identifier, 0, and 0. These three fields are added to the transaction data before it is encoded and hashed. They therefore change the transaction’s hash, to which the signature is later applied. By including the chain identifier in the data being signed, the transaction signature prevents any changes, as the signature is invalidated if the chain identifier is modified. Therefore, EIP-155 makes it impossible for a transaction to be replayed on another chain, because the signature’s validity depends on the chain identifier.\n\n\nThe chain identifier field takes a value according to the network the transaction is meant for, as outlined in Chain identifiers.\n\n\nTable 1. Chain identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain\nChain ID\n\n\n\n\nEthereum mainnet\n1\n\n\nMorden (obsolete), Expanse\n2\n\n\nRopsten\n3\n\n\nRinkeby\n4\n\n\nRootstock mainnet\n30\n\n\nRootstock testnet\n31\n\n\nKovan\n42\n\n\nEthereum Classic mainnet\n61\n\n\nEthereum Classic testnet\n62\n\n\nGeth private testnets\n1337\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting transaction structure is RLP-encoded, hashed, and signed. The signature algorithm is modified slightly to encode the chain identifier in the v prefix too.\n\n\nFor more details, see the EIP-155 specification.\n\n\n\n\nThe Signature Prefix Value (v) and Public Key Recovery\n\nAs mentioned in The Structure of a Transaction, the transaction message doesn’t include a \"from\" field. That’s because the originator’s public key can be computed directly from the ECDSA signature. Once you have the public key, you can compute the address easily. The process of recovering the signer’s public key is called public key recovery.\n\n\nGiven the values r and s that were computed in ECDSA Math, we can compute two possible public keys.\n\n\nFirst, we compute two elliptic curve points, R and R', from the x coordinate r value that is in the signature. There are two points because the elliptic curve is symmetric across the x-axis, so that for any value x there are two possible values that fit the curve, one on each side of the x-axis.\n\n\nFrom r we also calculate r-1, which is the multiplicative inverse of r.\n\n\nFinally, we calculate z, which is the n lowest bits of the message hash, where n is the order of the elliptic curve.\n\n\nThe two possible public keys are then:\n\n\nK1 = r–1 (sR – zG)\n\n\nand:\n\n\nK2 = r–1 (sR' – zG)\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nK1 and K2 are the two possibilities for the signer’s public key.\n\n\nr-1 is the multiplicative inverse of the signature’s r value.\n\n\ns is the signature’s s value.\n\n\nR and R' are the two possibilities for the ephemeral public key Q.\n\n\nz is the n-lowest bits of the message hash.\n\n\nG is the elliptic curve generator point.\n\n\n\n\nTo make things more efficient, the transaction signature includes a prefix value v, which tells us which of the two possible R values is the ephemeral public key. If v is even, then R is the correct value. If v is odd, then it is R'. That way, we need to calculate only one value for R and only one value for K.\n\n\n\nSeparating Signing and Transmission (Offline Signing)\n\nOnce a transaction is signed, it is ready to transmit to the Ethereum network. The three steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting a transaction normally happen as a single operation, for example using web3.eth.sendTransaction. However, as you saw in Raw Transaction Creation and Signing, you can create and sign the transaction in two separate steps. Once you have a signed transaction, you can then transmit it using web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction, which takes a hex-encoded and signed transaction and transmits it on the Ethereum network.\n\n\nWhy would you want to separate the signing and transmission of transactions? The most common reason is security. The computer that signs a transaction must have unlocked private keys loaded in memory. The computer that does the transmitting must be connected to the internet (and be running an Ethereum client). If these two functions are on one computer, then you have private keys on an online system, which is quite dangerous. Separating the functions of signing and transmitting and performing them on different machines (on an offline and an online device, respectively) is called offline signing and is a common security practice.\n\n\nOffline signing of Ethereum transactions shows the process:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an unsigned transaction on the online computer where the current state of the account, notably the current nonce and funds available, can be retrieved.\n\n\nTransfer the unsigned transaction to an \"air-gapped\" offline device for transaction signing, e.g., via a QR code or USB flash drive.\n\n\nTransmit the signed transaction (back) to an online device for broadcast on the Ethereum blockchain, e.g., via QR code or USB flash drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Offline signing of Ethereum transactions\n\n\nDepending on the level of security you need, your \"offline signing\" computer can have varying degrees of separation from the online computer, ranging from an isolated and firewalled subnet (online but segregated) to a completely offline system known as an air-gapped system. In an air-gapped system there is no network connectivity at all—the computer is separated from the online environment by a gap of \"air.\" To sign transactions you transfer them to and from the air-gapped computer using data storage media or (better) a webcam and QR code. Of course, this means you must manually transfer every transaction you want signed, and this doesn’t scale.\n\n\nWhile not many environments can utilize a fully air-gapped system, even a small degree of isolation has significant security benefits. For example, an isolated subnet with a firewall that only allows a message-queue protocol through can offer a much-reduced attack surface and much higher security than signing on the online system. Many companies use a protocol such as ZeroMQ (0MQ) for this purpose. With a setup like that, transactions are serialized and queued for signing. The queuing protocol transmits the serialized message, in a way similar to a TCP socket, to the signing computer. The signing computer reads the serialized transactions from the queue (carefully), applies a signature with the appropriate key, and places them on an outgoing queue. The outgoing queue transmits the signed transactions to a computer with an Ethereum client that dequeues them and transmits them.\n\n\n\nTransaction Propagation\n\nThe Ethereum network uses a \"flood routing\" protocol. Each Ethereum client acts as a node in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which (ideally) forms a mesh network. No network node is special: they all act as equal peers. We will use the term \"node\" to refer to an Ethereum client that is connected to and participates in the P2P network.\n\n\nTransaction propagation starts with the originating Ethereum node creating (or receiving from offline) a signed transaction. The transaction is validated and then transmitted to all the other Ethereum nodes that are directly connected to the originating node. On average, each Ethereum node maintains connections to at least 13 other nodes, called its neighbors. Each neighbor node validates the transaction as soon as they receive it. If they agree that it is valid, they store a copy and propagate it to all their neighbors (except the one it came from). As a result, the transaction ripples outwards from the originating node, flooding across the network, until all nodes in the network have a copy of the transaction. Nodes can filter the messages they propagate, but the default is to propagate all valid transaction messages they receive.\n\n\nWithin just a few seconds, an Ethereum transaction propagates to all the Ethereum nodes around the globe. From the perspective of each node, it is not possible to discern the origin of the transaction. The neighbor that sent it to the node may be the originator of the transaction or may have received it from one of its neighbors. To be able to track the origins of transactions, or interfere with propagation, an attacker would have to control a significant percentage of all nodes. This is part of the security and privacy design of P2P networks, especially as applied to blockchain networks.\n\n\n\nRecording on the Blockchain\n\nWhile all the nodes in Ethereum are equal peers, some of them are operated by miners and are feeding transactions and blocks to mining farms, which are computers with high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The mining computers add transactions to a candidate block and attempt to find a proof of work that makes the candidate block valid. We will discuss this in more detail in [consensus].\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail, valid transactions will eventually be included in a block of transactions and, thus, recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. Once mined into a block, transactions also modify the state of the Ethereum singleton, either by modifying the balance of an account (in the case of a simple payment) or by invoking contracts that change their internal state. These changes are recorded alongside the transaction, in the form of a transaction receipt, which may also include events. We will examine all this in much more detail in [evm_chapter].\n\n\nA transaction that has completed its journey from creation through signing by an EOA, propagation, and finally mining has changed the state of the singleton and left an indelible mark on the blockchain.\n\n\n\nMultiple-Signature (Multisig) Transactions\n\nIf you are familiar with Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities, you know that it is possible to create a Bitcoin multisig account which can only spend funds when multiple parties sign the transaction (e.g., 2 of 2 or 3 of 4 signatures). Ethereum’s basic EOA value transactions have no provisions for multiple signatures; however, arbitrary signing restrictions can be enforced by smart contracts with any conditions you can think of, to handle the transfer of ether and tokens alike.\n\n\nTo take advantage of this capability, ether has to be transferred to a \"wallet contract\" that is programmed with the spending rules desired, such as multisignature requirements or spending limits (or combinations of the two). The wallet contract then sends the funds when prompted by an authorized EOA once the spending conditions have been satisfied. For example, to protect your ether under a multisig condition, transfer the ether to a multisig contract. Whenever you want to send funds to another account, all the required users will need to send transactions to the contract using a regular wallet app, effectively authorizing the contract to perform the final transaction.\n\n\nThese contracts can also be designed to require multiple signatures before executing local code or to trigger other contracts. The security of the scheme is ultimately determined by the multisig contract code.\n\n\nThe ability to implement multisignature transactions as a smart contract demonstrates the flexiblity of Ethereum. However, it is a double-edged sword, as the extra flexibility can lead to bugs that undermine the security of multisignature schemes. There are, in fact, a number of proposals to create a multisignature command in the EVM that removes the need for smart contracts, at least for the simple M-of-N multisignature schemes. This would be equivalent to Bitcoin’s multisignature system, which is part of the core consensus rules and has proven to be robust and secure.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nTransactions are the starting point of every activity in the Ethereum system. Transactions are the \"inputs\" that cause the Ethereum Virtual Machine to evaluate contracts, update balances, and more generally modify the state of the Ethereum blockchain. Next, we will work with smart contracts in a lot more detail and learn how to program in the Solidity contract-oriented language.\n\n\n\n"},"07smart-contracts-solidity.html":{"url":"07smart-contracts-solidity.html","title":"Chapter 7: Smart Contracts and Solidity","keywords":"","body":"\nSmart Contracts and Solidity\n\n\nAs we discussed in [intro_chapter], there are two different types of accounts in Ethereum: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by users, often via software such as a wallet application that is external to the Ethereum platform. In contrast, contract accounts are controlled by program code (also commonly referred to as “smart contracts”) that is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In short, EOAs are simple accounts without any associated code or data storage, whereas contract accounts have both associated code and data storage. EOAs are controlled by transactions created and cryptographically signed with a private key in the \"real world\" external to and independent of the protocol, whereas contract accounts do not have private keys and so \"control themselves\" in the predetermined way prescribed by their smart contract code. Both types of accounts are identified by an Ethereum address. In this chapter, we will discuss contract accounts and the program code that controls them.\n\n\nWhat Is a Smart Contract?\n\nThe term smart contract has been used over the years to describe a wide variety of different things. In the 1990s, cryptographer Nick Szabo coined the term and defined it as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises.” Since then, the concept of smart contracts has evolved, especially after the introduction of decentralized blockchain platforms with the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. In the context of Ethereum, the term is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that Ethereum smart contracts are neither smart nor legal contracts, but the term has stuck. In this book, we use the term “smart contracts” to refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol—i.e., on the decentralized Ethereum world computer.\n\n\nLet’s unpack that definition:\n\n\n\nComputer programs\n\nSmart contracts are simply computer programs. The word “contract” has no legal meaning in this context.\n\nImmutable\n\nOnce deployed, the code of a smart contract cannot change. Unlike with traditional software, the only way to modify a smart contract is to deploy a new instance.\n\nDeterministic\n\nThe outcome of the execution of a smart contract is the same for everyone who runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the state of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment of execution.\n\nEVM context\n\nSmart contracts operate with a very limited execution context. They can access their own state, the context of the transaction that called them, and some information about the most recent blocks.\n\nDecentralized world computer\n\nThe EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum node, but because all instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and produce the same final state, the system as a whole operates as a single \"world computer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Cycle of a Smart Contract\n\nSmart contracts are typically written in a high-level language, such as Solidity. But in order to run, they must be compiled to the low-level bytecode that runs in the EVM. Once compiled, they are deployed on the Ethereum platform using a special contract creation transaction, which is identified as such by being sent to the special contract creation address, namely 0x0 (see [contract_reg]). Each contract is identified by an Ethereum address, which is derived from the contract creation transaction as a function of the originating account and nonce. The Ethereum address of a contract can be used in a transaction as the recipient, sending funds to the contract or calling one of the contract’s functions. Note that, unlike with EOAs, there are no keys associated with an account created for a new smart contract. As the contract creator, you don’t get any special privileges at the protocol level (although you can explicitly code them into the smart contract). You certainly don’t receive the private key for the contract account, which in fact does not exist—we can say that smart contract accounts own themselves.\n\n\nImportantly, contracts only run if they are called by a transaction. All smart contracts in Ethereum are executed, ultimately, because of a transaction initiated from an EOA. A contract can call another contract that can call another contract, and so on, but the first contract in such a chain of execution will always have been called by a transaction from an EOA. Contracts never run “on their own” or “in the background.” Contracts effectively lie dormant until a transaction triggers execution, either directly or indirectly as part of a chain of contract calls. It is also worth noting that smart contracts are not executed \"in parallel\" in any sense—the Ethereum world computer can be considered to be a single-threaded machine.\n\n\nTransactions are atomic, regardless of how many contracts they call or what those contracts do when called. Transactions execute in their entirety, with any changes in the global state (contracts, accounts, etc.) recorded only if all execution terminates successfully. Successful termination means that the program executed without an error and reached the end of execution. If execution fails due to an error, all of its effects (changes in state) are “rolled back” as if the transaction never ran. A failed transaction is still recorded as having been attempted, and the ether spent on gas for the execution is deducted from the originating account, but it otherwise has no other effects on contract or account state.\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, it is important to remember that a contract’s code cannot be changed. However, a contract can be “deleted,” removing the code and its internal state (storage) from its address, leaving a blank account. Any transactions sent to that account address after the contract has been deleted do not result in any code execution, because there is no longer any code there to execute. To delete a contract, you execute an EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT (previously called SUICIDE). That operation costs “negative gas,” a gas refund, thereby incentivizing the release of network client resources from the deletion of stored state. Deleting a contract in this way does not remove the transaction history (past) of the contract, since the blockchain itself is immutable. It is also important to note that the SELFDESTRUCT capability will only be available if the contract author programmed the smart contract to have that functionality. If the contract’s code does not have a SELFDESTRUCT opcode, or it is inaccessible, the smart contract cannot be deleted.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Ethereum High-Level Languages\n\nThe EVM is a virtual machine that runs a special form of code called EVM bytecode, analogous to your computer’s CPU, which runs machine code such as x86_64. We will examine the operation and language of the EVM in much more detail in [evm_chapter]. In this section we will look at how smart contracts are written to run on the EVM.\n\n\nWhile it is possible to program smart contracts directly in bytecode, EVM bytecode is rather unwieldy and very difficult for programmers to read and understand. Instead, most Ethereum developers use a high-level language to write programs, and a compiler to convert them into bytecode.\n\n\nWhile any high-level language could be adapted to write smart contracts, adapting an arbitrary language to be compilable to EVM bytecode is quite a cumbersome exercise and would in general lead to some amount of confusion. Smart contracts operate in a highly constrained and minimalistic execution environment (the EVM). In addition, a special set of EVM-specific system variables and functions needs to be available. As such, it is easier to build a smart contract language from scratch than it is to make a general-purpose language suitable for writing smart contracts. As a result, a number of special-purpose languages have emerged for programming smart contracts. Ethereum has several such languages, together with the compilers needed to produce EVM-executable bytecode.\n\n\nIn general, programming languages can be classified into two broad programming paradigms: declarative and imperative, also known as functional and procedural, respectively. In declarative programming, we write functions that express the logic of a program, but not its flow. Declarative programming is used to create programs where there are no side effects, meaning that there are no changes to state outside of a function. Declarative programming languages include Haskell and SQL. Imperative programming, by contrast, is where a programmer writes a set of procedures that combine the logic and flow of a program. Imperative programming languages include C++ and Java. Some languages are “hybrid,” meaning that they encourage declarative programming but can also be used to express an imperative programming paradigm. Such hybrids include Lisp, JavaScript, and Python. In general, any imperative language can be used to write in a declarative paradigm, but it often results in inelegant code. By comparison, pure declarative languages cannot be used to write in an imperative paradigm. In purely declarative languages, there are no “variables.”\n\n\nWhile imperative programming is more commonly used by programmers, it can be very difficult to write programs that execute exactly as expected. The ability of any part of the program to change the state of any other makes it difficult to reason about a program’s execution and introduces many opportunities for bugs. Declarative programming, by comparison, makes it easier to understand how a program will behave: since it has no side effects, any part of a program can be understood in isolation.\n\n\nIn smart contracts, bugs literally cost money. As a result, it is critically important to write smart contracts without unintended effects. To do that, you must be able to clearly reason about the expected behavior of the program. So, declarative languages play a much bigger role in smart contracts than they do in general-purpose software. Nevertheless, as you will see, the most widely used language for smart contracts (Solidity) is imperative. Programmers, like most humans, resist change!\n\n\nCurrently supported high-level programming languages for smart contracts include (ordered by approximate age):\n\n\n\nLLL\n\nA functional (declarative) programming language, with Lisp-like syntax. It was the first high-level language for Ethereum smart contracts but is rarely used today.\n\nSerpent\n\nA procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to Python. Can also be used to write functional (declarative) code, though it is not entirely free of side effects.\n\nSolidity\n\nA procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to JavaScript, C++, or Java. The most popular and frequently used language for Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nVyper\n\nA more recently developed language, similar to Serpent and again with Python-like syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure-functional Python-like language than Serpent, but not to replace Serpent.\n\nBamboo\n\nA newly developed language, influenced by Erlang, with explicit state transitions and without iterative flows (loops). Intended to reduce side effects and increase auditability. Very new and yet to be widely adopted.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are many languages to choose from. However, of all of these Solidity is by far the most popular, to the point of being the de facto high-level language of Ethereum and even other EVM-like blockchains. We will spend most of our time using Solidity, but will also explore some of the examples in other high-level languages to gain an understanding of their different philosophies.\n\n\n\nBuilding a Smart Contract with Solidity\n\nSolidity was created by Dr. Gavin Wood (coauthor of this book) as a language explicitly for writing smart contracts with features to directly support execution in the decentralized environment of the Ethereum world computer. The resulting attributes are quite general, and so it has ended up being used for coding smart contracts on several other blockchain platforms. It was developed by Christian Reitiwessner and then also by Alex Beregszaszi, Liana Husikyan, Yoichi Hirai, and several former Ethereum core contributors. Solidity is now developed and maintained as an independent project on GitHub.\n\n\nThe main \"product\" of the Solidity project is the Solidity compiler, solc, which converts programs written in the Solidity language to EVM bytecode. The project also manages the important application binary interface (ABI) standard for Ethereum smart contracts, which we will explore in detail in this chapter. Each version of the Solidity compiler corresponds to and compiles a specific version of the Solidity language.\n\n\nTo get started, we will download a binary executable of the Solidity compiler. Then we will develop and compile a simple contract, following on from the example we started with in [intro_chapter].\n\n\nSelecting a Version of Solidity\n\nSolidity follows a versioning model called semantic versioning, which specifies version numbers structured as three numbers separated by dots: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The \"major\" number is incremented for major and backward-incompatible changes, the \"minor\" number is incremented as backward-compatible features are added in between major releases, and the \"patch\" number is incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Solidity is at version 0.4.24.  The rules for major version 0, which is for initial development of a project, are different: anything may change at any time. In practice, Solidity treats the \"minor\" number as if it were the major version and the \"patch\" number as if it were the minor version. Therefore, in 0.4.24, 4 is considered to be the major version and 24 the minor version.\n\n\nThe 0.5 major version release of Solidity is anticipated imminently.\n\n\nAs you saw in [intro_chapter], your Solidity programs can contain a pragma directive that specifies the minimum and maximum versions of Solidity that it is compatible with, and can be used to compile your contract.\n\n\nSince Solidity is rapidly evolving, it is often better to install the latest release.\n\n\n\nDownload and Install\n\nThere are a number of methods you can use to download and install Solidity, either as a binary release or by compiling from source code. You can find detailed instructions in the Solidity documentation.\n\n\nHere’s how to install the latest binary release of Solidity on an Ubuntu/Debian operating system, using the apt package manager:\n\n\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install solc\n\n\nOnce you have solc installed, check the version by running:\n\n\n$ solc --version\nsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interface\nVersion: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++\n\n\nThere are a number of other ways to install Solidity, depending on your operating system and requirements, including compiling from the source code directly. For more information see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.\n\n\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nTo develop in Solidity, you can use any text editor and solc on the command line. However, you might find that some text editors designed for development, such as Emacs, Vim, and Atom, offer additional features such as syntax highlighting and macros that make Solidity development easier.\n\n\nThere are also web-based development environments, such as Remix IDE and EthFiddle.\n\n\nUse the tools that make you productive. In the end, Solidity programs are just plain text files. While fancy editors and development environments can make things easier, you don’t need anything more than a simple text editor, such as nano (Linux/Unix), TextEdit (macOS), or even NotePad (Windows). Simply save your program source code with a .sol extension and it will be recognized by the Solidity compiler as a Solidity program.\n\n\n\nWriting a Simple Solidity Program\n\nIn [intro_chapter], we wrote our first Solidity program.  When we first built the Faucet contract, we used the Remix IDE to compile and deploy the contract. In this section, we will revisit, improve, and embellish Faucet.\n\n\nOur first attempt looked like Faucet.sol: A Solidity contract implementing a faucet.\n\n\nExample 1. Faucet.sol: A Solidity contract implementing a faucet\n\n\n\nlink:code/Solidity/Faucet.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiling with the Solidity Compiler (solc)\n\nNow, we will use the Solidity compiler on the command line to compile our contract directly. The Solidity compiler solc offers a variety of options, which you can see by passing the --help argument.\n\n\nWe use the --bin and --optimize arguments of solc to produce an optimized binary of our example contract:\n\n\n$ solc --optimize --bin Faucet.sol\n======= Faucet.sol:Faucet =======\nBinary:\n6060604052341561000f57600080fd5b60cf8061001d6000396000f300606060405260043610603e5\n763ffffffff7c01000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000350416\n632e1a7d4d81146040575b005b3415604a57600080fd5b603e60043567016345785d8a00008111156\n06357600080fd5b73ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff331681156108fc0282604051\n600060405180830381858888f19350505050151560a057600080fd5b505600a165627a7a723058203\n556d79355f2da19e773a9551e95f1ca7457f2b5fbbf4eacf7748ab59d2532130029\n\n\nThe result that solc produces is a hex-serialized binary that can be submitted to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Contract ABI\n\nIn computer software, an application binary interface is an interface between two program modules; often, between the operating system and user programs. An ABI defines how data structures and functions are accessed in machine code; this is not to be confused with an API, which defines this access in high-level, often human-readable formats as source code. The ABI is thus the primary way of encoding and decoding data into and out of machine code.\n\n\nIn Ethereum, the ABI is used to encode contract calls for the EVM and to read data out of transactions. The purpose of an ABI is to define the functions in the contract that can be invoked and describe how each function will accept arguments and return its result.\n\n\nA contract’s ABI is specified as a JSON array of function descriptions (see Functions) and events (see Events). A function description is a JSON object with fields type, name, inputs, outputs, constant, and payable. An event description object has fields type, name, inputs, and anonymous.\n\n\nWe use the solc command-line Solidity compiler to produce the ABI for our Faucet.sol example contract:\n\n\n$ solc --abi Faucet.sol\n======= Faucet.sol:Faucet =======\nContract JSON ABI\n[{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"withdraw_amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}], \\\n\"name\":\"withdraw\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\", \\\n\"type\":\"function\"},{\"payable\":true,\"stateMutability\":\"payable\", \\\n\"type\":\"fallback\"}]\n\n\nAs you can see, the compiler produces a JSON array describing the two functions that are defined by Faucet.sol. This JSON can be used by any application that wants to access the Faucet contract once it is deployed. Using the ABI, an application such as a wallet or DApp browser can construct transactions that call the functions in Faucet with the correct arguments and argument types. For example, a wallet would know that to call the function withdraw it would have to provide a uint256 argument named withdraw_amount. The wallet could prompt the user to provide that value, then create a transaction that encodes it and executes the withdraw function.\n\n\nAll that is needed for an application to interact with a contract is an ABI and the address where the contract has been deployed.\n\n\nSelecting a Solidity Compiler and Language Version\n\nAs we saw in the previous code, our Faucet contract compiles successfully with Solidity version 0.4.21. But what if we had used a different version of the Solidity compiler? The language is still in constant flux and things may change in unexpected ways. Our contract is fairly simple, but what if our program used a feature that was only added in Solidity version 0.4.19 and we tried to compile it with 0.4.18?\n\n\nTo resolve such issues, Solidity offers a compiler directive known as a version pragma that instructs the compiler that the program expects a specific compiler (and language) version. Let’s look at an example:\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n\n\n\nThe Solidity compiler reads the version pragma and will produce an error if the compiler version is incompatible with the version pragma. In this case, our version pragma says that this program can be compiled by a Solidity compiler with a minimum version of 0.4.19. The symbol ^ states, however, that we allow compilation with any minor revision above 0.4.19; e.g., 0.4.20, but not 0.5.0 (which is a major revision, not a minor revision). Pragma directives are not compiled into EVM bytecode. They are only used by the compiler to check compatibility.\n\n\nLet’s add a pragma directive to our Faucet contract. We will name the new file Faucet2.sol, to keep track of our changes as we proceed through these examples starting in Faucet2.sol: Adding the version pragma to Faucet.\n\n\nExample 2. Faucet2.sol: Adding the version pragma to Faucet\n\n\n\nlink:code/Solidity/Faucet2.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a version pragma is a best practice, as it avoids problems with mismatched compiler and language versions. We will explore other best practices and continue to improve the Faucet contract throughout this chapter.\n\n\n\n\nProgramming with Solidity\n\nIn this section, we will look at some of the capabilities of the Solidity language. As we mentioned in [intro_chapter], our first contract example was very simple and also flawed in various ways. We’ll gradually improve it here, while exploring how to use Solidity. This won’t be a comprehensive Solidity tutorial, however, as Solidity is quite complex and rapidly evolving. We’ll cover the basics and give you enough of a foundation to be able to explore the rest on your own. The documentation for Solidity can be found\non the project website.\n\n\nData Types\n\nFirst, let’s look at some of the basic data types offered in Solidity:\n\n\n\nBoolean (bool)\n\nBoolean value, true or false, with logical operators ! (not), && (and), || (or), == (equal), and != (not equal).\n\nInteger (int, uint)\n\nSigned (int) and unsigned (uint) integers, declared in increments of 8 bits from int8 to uint256. Without a size suffix, 256-bit quantities are used, to match the word size of the EVM.\n\nFixed point (fixed, ufixed)\n\nFixed-point numbers, declared with (u)fixedMxN where M is the size in bits (increments of 8 up to 256) and N is the number of decimals after the point (up to 18); e.g., ufixed32x2.\n\nAddress\n\nA 20-byte Ethereum address. The address object has many helpful member functions, the main ones being balance (returns the account balance) and transfer (transfers ether to the account).\n\nByte array (fixed)\n\nFixed-size arrays of bytes, declared with bytes1 up to bytes32.\n\nByte array (dynamic)\n\nVariable-sized arrays of bytes, declared with bytes or string.\n\nEnum\n\nUser-defined type for enumerating discrete values: enum NAME {LABEL1, LABEL 2, ...}.\n\nArrays\n\nAn array of any type, either fixed or dynamic: uint32[][5] is a fixed-size array of five dynamic arrays of unsigned integers.\n\nStruct\n\nUser-defined data containers for grouping variables: struct NAME {TYPE1 VARIABLE1; TYPE2 VARIABLE2; ...}.\n\nMapping\n\nHash lookup tables for key => value pairs: mapping(KEY_TYPE => VALUE_TYPE) NAME.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these data types, Solidity also offers a variety of value literals that can be used to calculate different units:\n\n\n\nTime units\n\nThe units seconds, minutes, hours, and days can be used as suffixes, converting to multiples of the base unit seconds.\n\nEther units\n\nThe units wei, finney, szabo, and ether can be used as suffixes, converting to multiples of the base unit wei.\n\n\n\n\nIn our Faucet contract example, we used a uint (which is an alias for uint256) for the withdraw_amount variable. We also indirectly used an address variable, which we set with msg.sender. We will use more of these data types in our examples in the rest of this chapter.\n\n\nLet’s use one of the unit multipliers to improve the readability of our example contract. In the withdraw function we limit the maximum withdrawal, expressing the limit in wei, the base unit of ether:\n\n\n\nrequire(withdraw_amount \n\n\n\nThat’s not very easy to read. We can improve our code by using the unit multiplier ether, to express the value in ether instead of wei:\n\n\n\nrequire(withdraw_amount \n\n\n\n\nPredefined Global Variables and Functions\n\nWhen a contract is executed in the EVM, it has access to a small set of global objects. These include the block, msg, and tx objects. In addition, Solidity exposes a number of EVM opcodes as predefined functions. In this section we will examine the variables and functions you can access from within a smart contract in Solidity.\n\n\nTransaction/message call context\n\nThe msg object is the transaction call (EOA originated) or message call (contract originated) that launched this contract execution. It contains a number of useful attributes:\n\n\n\nmsg.sender\n\nWe’ve already used this one. It represents the address that initiated this contract call, not necessarily the originating EOA that sent the transaction. If our contract was called directly by an EOA transaction, then this is the address that signed the transaction, but otherwise it will be a contract address.\n\nmsg.value\n\nThe value of ether sent with this call (in wei).\n\nmsg.gas\n\nThe amount of gas left in the gas supply of this execution environment. This was deprecated in Solidity v0.4.21 and replaced by the gasleft function.\n\nmsg.data\n\nThe data payload of this call into our contract.\n\nmsg.sig\n\nThe first four bytes of the data payload, which is the function selector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhenever a contract calls another contract, the values of all the attributes of msg change to reflect the new caller’s information. The only exception to this is the delegatecall function, which runs the code of another contract/library within the original msg context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction context\n\nThe tx object provides a means of accessing transaction-related information:\n\n\n\ntx.gasprice\n\nThe gas price in the calling transaction.\n\ntx.origin\n\nThe address of the originating EOA for this transaction. WARNING: unsafe!\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock context\n\nThe block object contains information about the current block:\n\n\n\nblock.blockhash(__blockNumber__)\n\nThe block hash of the specified block number, up to 256 blocks in the past. Deprecated and replaced with the blockhash function in Solidity v0.4.22.\n\nblock.coinbase\n\nThe address of the recipient of the current block’s fees and block reward.\n\nblock.difficulty\n\nThe difficulty (proof of work) of the current block.\n\nblock.gaslimit\n\nThe maximum amount of gas that can be spent across all transactions included in the current block.\n\nblock.number\n\nThe current block number (blockchain height).\n\nblock.timestamp\n\nThe timestamp placed in the current block by the miner (number of seconds since the Unix epoch).\n\n\n\n\n\naddress object\n\nAny address, either passed as an input or cast from a contract object, has a number of attributes and methods:\n\n\n\naddress.balance\n\nThe balance of the address, in wei. For example, the current contract balance is address(this).balance.\n\naddress.transfer(__amount__)\n\nTransfers the amount (in wei) to this address, throwing an exception on any error. We used this function in our Faucet example as a method on the msg.sender address, as msg.sender.transfer.\n\naddress.send(__amount__)\n\nSimilar to transfer, only instead of throwing an exception, it returns false on error. WARNING: always check the return value of send.\n\naddress.call(__payload__)\n\nLow-level CALL function—can construct an arbitrary message call with a data payload. Returns false on error. WARNING: unsafe—recipient can (accidentally or maliciously) use up all your gas, causing your contract to halt with an OOG exception; always check the return value of call.\n\naddress.callcode(__payload__)\n\nLow-level CALLCODE function, like address(this).call(...) but with this contract’s code replaced with that of address. Returns false on error. WARNING: advanced use only!\n\naddress.delegatecall()\n\nLow-level DELEGATECALL function, like callcode(...) but with the full msg context seen by the current contract. Returns false on error. WARNING: advanced use only!\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in functions\n\nOther functions worth noting are:\n\n\n\naddmod, mulmod\n\nFor modulo addition and multiplication. For example, addmod(x,y,k) calculates (x + y) % k.\n\nkeccak256, sha256, sha3, ripemd160\n\nFunctions to calculate hashes with various standard hash algorithms.\n\necrecover\n\nRecovers the address used to sign a message from the signature.\n\nselfdestrunct(__recipient_address__)\n\nDeletes the current contract, sending any remaining ether in the account to the recipient address.\n\nthis\n\nThe address of the currently executing contract account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract Definition\n\nSolidity’s principal data type is contract; our Faucet example simply defines a contract object. Similar to any object in an object-oriented language, the contract is a container that includes data and methods.\n\n\nSolidity offers two other object types that are similar to a contract:\n\n\n\ninterface\n\nAn interface definition is structured exactly like a contract, except none of the functions are defined, they are only declared. This type of declaration is often called a stub; it tells you the functions' arguments and return types without any implementation. An interface specifies the \"shape\" of a contract; when inherited, each of the functions declared by the interface must be defined by the child.\n\nlibrary\n\nA library contract is one that is meant to be deployed only once and used by other contracts, using the delegatecall method (see address object).\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\nWithin a contract, we define functions that can be called by an EOA transaction or another contract. In our Faucet example, we have two functions: withdraw and the (unnamed) fallback function.\n\n\nThe syntax we use to declare a function in Solidity is as follows:\n\n\nfunction FunctionName([parameters]) {public|private|internal|external}\n[pure|constant|view|payable] [modifiers] [returns (return types)]\n\n\nLet’s look at each of these components:\n\n\n\nFunctionName\n\nThe name of the function, which is used to call the function in a transaction (from an EOA), from another contract, or even from within the same contract. One function in each contract may be defined without a name, in which case it is the fallback function, which is called when no other function is named. The fallback function cannot have any arguments or return anything.\n\nparameters\n\nFollowing the name, we specify the arguments that must be passed to the function, with their names and types. In our Faucet example we defined uint withdraw_amount as the only argument to the withdraw function.\n\n\n\n\nThe next set of keywords (public, private, internal, external) specify the function’s visibility:\n\n\n\npublic\n\nPublic is the default; such functions can be called by other contracts or EOA transactions, or from within the contract. In our Faucet example, both functions are defined as public.\n\nexternal\n\nExternal functions are like public functions, except they cannot be called from within the contract unless explicitly prefixed with the keyword this.\n\ninternal\n\nInternal functions are only accessible from within the contract—they cannot be called by another contract or EOA transaction. They can be called by derived contracts (those that inherit this one).\n\nprivate\n\nPrivate functions are like internal functions but cannot be called by derived contracts.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the terms internal and private are somewhat misleading. Any function or data inside a contract is always visible on the public blockchain, meaning that anyone can see the code or data. The keywords described here only affect how and when a function can be called.\n\n\nThe second set of keywords (pure, constant, view, payable) affect the behavior of the function:\n\n\n\nconstant or view\n\nA function marked as a view promises not to modify any state. The term constant is an alias for view that will be deprecated in a future release. At this time, the compiler does not enforce the view modifier, only producing a warning, but this is expected to become an enforced keyword in v0.5 of Solidity.\n\npure\n\nA pure function is one that neither reads nor writes any variables in storage. It can only operate on arguments and return data, without reference to any stored data. Pure functions are intended to encourage declarative-style programming without side effects or state.\n\npayable\n\nA payable function is one that can accept incoming payments. Functions not declared as payable will reject incoming payments. There are two exceptions, due to design decisions in the EVM: coinbase payments and SELFDESTRUCT inheritance will be paid even if the fallback function is not declared as payable, but this makes sense because code execution is not part of those payments anyway.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in our Faucet example, we have one payable function (the fallback function), which is the only function that can receive incoming payments.\n\n\n\nContract Constructor and selfdestruct\n\nThere is a special function that is only used once. When a contract is created, it also runs the constructor function if one exists, to initialize the state of the contract. The constructor is run in the same transaction as the contract creation. The constructor function is optional; you’ll notice our Faucet example doesn’t have one.\n\n\nConstructors can be specified in two ways. Up to and including in Solidity v0.4.21, the constructor is a function whose name matches the name of the contract, as you can see here:\n\n\n\ncontract MEContract {\n\tfunction MEContract() {\n\t\t// This is the constructor\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nThe difficulty with this format is that if the contract name is changed and the constructor function name is not changed, it is no longer a constructor. Likewise, if there is an accidental typo in the naming of the contract and/or constructor, the function is again no longer a constructor. This can cause some pretty nasty, unexpected, and difficult-to-find bugs. Imagine for example if the constructor is setting the owner of the contract for purposes of control. If the function is not actually the constructor because of a naming error, not only will the owner be left unset at the time of contract creation, but the function may also be deployed as a permanent and \"callable\" part of the contract, like a normal function, allowing any third party to hijack the contract and become the \"owner\" after contract creation.\n\n\nTo address the potential problems with constructor functions being based on having an identical name as the contract, Solidity v0.4.22 introduces a constructor keyword that operates like a constructor function but does not have a name. Renaming the contract does not affect the constructor at all. Also, it is easier to identify which function is the constructor. It looks like this:\n\n\n\npragma ^0.4.22\ncontract MEContract {\n\tconstructor () {\n\t\t// This is the constructor\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nTo summarize, a contract’s life cycle starts with a creation transaction from an EOA or contract account. If there is a constructor, it is executed as part of contract creation, to initialize the state of the contract as it is being created, and is then discarded.\n\n\nThe other end of the contract’s life cycle is contract destruction. Contracts are destroyed by a special EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT. It used to be called SUICIDE, but that name was deprecated due to the negative associations of the word. In Solidity, this opcode is exposed as a high-level built-in function called selfdestruct, which takes one argument: the address to receive any ether balance remaining in the contract account. It looks like this:\n\n\n\nselfdestruct(address recipient);\n\n\n\nNote that you must explicitly add this command to your contract if you want it to be deletable—this is the only way a contract can be deleted, and it is not present by default. In this way, users of a contract who might rely on a contract being there forever can be certain that a contract can’t be deleted if it doesn’t contain a SELFDESTRUCT opcode.\n\n\n\nAdding a Constructor and selfdestruct to Our Faucet Example\n\nThe Faucet example contract we introduced in [intro_chapter] does not have any constructor or selfdestruct functions. It is an eternal contract that cannot be deleted. Let’s change that, by adding a constructor and selfdestruct function. We probably want selfdestruct to be callable only by the EOA that originally created the contract. By convention, this is usually stored in an address variable called owner. Our constructor sets the owner variable, and the selfdestruct function will first check that the owner called it directly.\n\n\nFirst, our constructor:\n\n\n\n// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for\npragma solidity ^0.4.22;\n\n// Our first contract is a faucet!\ncontract Faucet {\n\n\taddress owner;\n\n\t// Initialize Faucet contract: set owner\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\towner = msg.sender;\n\t}\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nWe’ve changed the pragma directive to specify v0.4.22 as the minimum version for this example, as we are using the new constructor keyword introduced in v0.4.22 of Solidity. Our contract now has an address type variable named owner. The name \"owner\" is not special in any way. We could call this address variable \"potato\" and still use it the same way. The name owner simply makes its purpose clear.\n\n\nNext, our constructor, which runs as part of the contract creation transaction, assigns the address from msg.sender to the owner variable. We used msg.sender in the withdraw function to identify the initiator of the withdrawal request. In the constructor, however, the msg.sender is the EOA or contract address that initiated contract creation. We know this is the case because this is a constructor function: it only runs once, during contract creation.\n\n\nNow we can add a function to destroy the contract. We need to make sure that only the owner can run this function, so we will use a require statement to control access. Here’s how it will look:\n\n\n\n// Contract destructor\nfunction destroy() public {\n\trequire(msg.sender == owner);\n\tselfdestruct(owner);\n}\n\n\n\nIf anyone calls this destroy function from an address other than owner, it will fail. But if the same address stored in owner by the constructor calls it, the contract will self-destruct and send any remaining balance to the owner address. Note that we did not use the unsafe tx.origin to determine whether the owner wished to destroy the contract—using tx.orgin would allow malign contracts to destroy your contract without your permission.\n\n\n\nFunction Modifiers\n\nSolidity offers a special type of function called a function modifier. You apply modifiers to functions by adding the modifier name in the function declaration. Modifiers are most often used to create conditions that apply to many functions within a contract. We have an access control statement already, in our destroy function. Let’s create a function modifier that expresses that condition:\n\n\n\nmodifier onlyOwner {\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\n    _;\n}\n\n\n\nThis function modifier, named onlyOwner, sets a condition on any function that it modifies, requiring that the address stored as the owner of the contract is the same as the address of the transaction’s msg.sender. This is the basic design pattern for access control, allowing only the owner of a contract to execute any function that has the onlyOwner modifier.\n\n\nYou may have noticed that our function modifier has a peculiar syntactic \"placeholder\" in it, an underscore followed by a semicolon (&#95;;). This placeholder is replaced by the code of the function that is being modified. Essentially, the modifier is \"wrapped around\" the modified function, placing its code in the location identified by the underscore character.\n\n\nTo apply a modifier, you add its name to the function declaration. More than one modifier can be applied to a function; they are applied in the sequence they are declared, as a comma-separated list.\n\n\nLet’s rewrite our destroy function to use the onlyOwner modifier:\n\n\n\nfunction destroy() public onlyOwner {\n    selfdestruct(owner);\n}\n\n\n\nThe function modifier’s name (onlyOwner) is after the keyword public and tells us that the destroy function is modified by the onlyOwner modifier. Essentially, you can read this as \"Only the owner can destroy this contract.\" In practice, the resulting code is equivalent to \"wrapping\" the code from onlyOwner around destroy.\n\n\nFunction modifiers are an extremely useful tool because they allow us to write preconditions for functions and apply them consistently, making the code easier to read and, as a result, easier to audit for security. They are most often used for access control, but they are quite versatile and can be used for a variety of other purposes.\n\n\nInside a modifier, you can access all the values (variables and arguments) visible to the modified function. In this case, we can access the owner variable, which is declared within the contract. However, the inverse is not true: you cannot access any of the modifier’s variables inside the modified function.\n\n\n\nContract Inheritance\n\nSolidity’s contract object supports inheritance, which is a mechanism for extending a base contract with additional functionality. To use inheritance, specify a parent contract with the keyword is:\n\n\n\ncontract Child is Parent {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nWith this construct, the Child contract inherits all the methods, functionality, and variables of Parent. Solidity also supports multiple inheritance, which can be specified by comma-separated contract names after the keyword is:\n\n\n\ncontract Child is Parent1, Parent2 {\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nContract inheritance allows us to write our contracts in such a way as to achieve modularity, extensibility, and reuse. We start with contracts that are simple and implement the most generic capabilities, then extend them by inheriting those capabilities in more specialized contracts.\n\n\nIn our Faucet contract, we introduced the constructor and destructor, together with access control for an owner, assigned on construction. Those capabilities are quite generic: many contracts will have them. We can define them as generic contracts, then use inheritance to extend them to the Faucet contract.\n\n\nWe start by defining a base contract owned, which has an owner variable, setting it in the contract’s constructor:\n\n\n\ncontract owned {\n\taddress owner;\n\n\t// Contract constructor: set owner\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\towner = msg.sender;\n\t}\n\n\t// Access control modifier\n\tmodifier onlyOwner {\n\t    require(msg.sender == owner);\n\t    _;\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nNext, we define a base contract mortal, which inherits owned:\n\n\n\ncontract mortal is owned {\n\t// Contract destructor\n\tfunction destroy() public onlyOwner {\n\t\tselfdestruct(owner);\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the mortal contract can use the onlyOwner function modifier, defined in owned. It indirectly also uses the owner address variable and the constructor defined in owned. Inheritance makes each contract simpler and focused on its specific functionality, allowing us to manage the details in a modular way.\n\n\nNow we can further extend the owned contract, inheriting its capabilities in Faucet:\n\n\n\ncontract Faucet is mortal {\n    // Give out ether to anyone who asks\n    function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n        // Limit withdrawal amount\n        require(withdraw_amount \n\n\n\nBy inheriting mortal, which in turn inherits owned, the Faucet contract now has the constructor and destroy functions, and a defined owner. The functionality is the same as when those functions were within Faucet, but now we can reuse those functions in other contracts without writing them again. Code reuse and modularity make our code cleaner, easier to read, and easier to audit.\n\n\n\nError Handling (assert, require, revert)\n\nA contract call can terminate and return an error. Error handling in Solidity is handled by four functions: assert, require, revert, and throw (now deprecated).\n\n\nWhen a contract terminates with an error, all the state changes (changes to variables, balances, etc.) are reverted, all the way up the chain of contract calls if more than one contract was called. This ensures that transactions are atomic, meaning they either complete successfully or have no effect on state and are reverted entirely.\n\n\nThe assert and require functions operate in the same way, evaluating a condition and stopping execution with an error if the condition is false. By convention, assert is used when the outcome is expected to be true, meaning that we use assert to test internal conditions. By comparison, require is used when testing inputs (such as function arguments or transaction fields), setting our expectations for those conditions.\n\n\nWe’ve used require in our function modifier onlyOwner, to test that the message sender is the owner of the contract:\n\n\n\nrequire(msg.sender == owner);\n\n\n\nThe require function acts as a gate condition, preventing execution of the rest of the function and producing an error if it is not satisfied.\n\n\nAs of Solidity v0.4.22, require can also include a helpful text message that can be used to show the reason for the error. The error message is recorded in the transaction log. So, we can improve our code by adding an error message in our require function:\n\n\n\nrequire(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the contract owner can call this function\");\n\n\n\nThe revert and throw functions halt the execution of the contract and revert any state changes. The throw function is obsolete and will be removed in future versions of Solidity; you should use revert instead. The revert function can also take an error message as the only argument, which is recorded in the transaction log.\n\n\nCertain conditions in a contract will generate errors regardless of whether we explicitly check for them. For example, in our Faucet contract, we don’t check whether there is enough ether to satisfy a withdrawal request. That’s because the transfer function will fail with an error and revert the transaction if there is insufficient balance to make the transfer:\n\n\n\nmsg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n\n\n\nHowever, it might be better to check explicitly and provide a clear error message on failure. We can do that by adding a require statement before the transfer:\n\n\n\nrequire(this.balance >= withdraw_amount,\n\t\"Insufficient balance in faucet for withdrawal request\");\nmsg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n\n\n\nAdditional error-checking code like this will increase gas consumption slightly, but it offers better error reporting than if omitted. You will need to find the right balance between gas consumption and verbose error checking based on the expected use of your contract. In the case of a Faucet contract intended for a testnet, we’d probably err on the side of extra reporting even if it costs more gas. Perhaps for a mainnet contract we’d choose to be frugal with our gas usage instead.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWhen a transaction completes (successfully or not), it produces a transaction receipt, as we will see in [evm_chapter]. The transaction receipt contains log entries that provide information about the actions that occurred during the execution of the transaction. Events are the Solidity high-level objects that are used to construct these logs.\n\n\nEvents are especially useful for light clients and DApp services, which can \"watch\" for specific events and report them to the user interface, or make a change in the state of the application to reflect an event in an underlying contract.\n\n\nEvent objects take arguments that are serialized and recorded in the transaction logs, in the blockchain. You can supply the keyword indexed before an argument, to make the value part of an indexed table (hash table) that can be searched or filtered by an application.\n\n\nWe have not added any events in our Faucet example so far, so let’s do that. We will add two events, one to log any withdrawals and one to log any deposits. We will call these events Withdrawal and Deposit, respectively. First, we define the events in the Faucet contract:\n\n\n\ncontract Faucet is mortal {\n\tevent Withdrawal(address indexed to, uint amount);\n\tevent Deposit(address indexed from, uint amount);\n\n\t[...]\n}\n\n\n\nWe’ve chosen to make the addresses indexed, to allow searching and filtering in any user interface built to access our Faucet.\n\n\nNext, we use the emit keyword to incorporate the event data in the transaction logs:\n\n\n\n// Give out ether to anyone who asks\nfunction withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n    [...]\n    msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);\n    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, withdraw_amount);\n}\n// Accept any incoming amount\nfunction () public payable {\n    emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);\n}\n\n\n\nThe resulting Faucet.sol contract looks like Faucet8.sol: Revised Faucet contract, with events.\n\n\nExample 3. Faucet8.sol: Revised Faucet contract, with events\n\n\n\nlink:code/Solidity/Faucet8.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nCatching events\n\nOK, so we’ve set up our contract to emit events. How do we see the results of a transaction and \"catch\" the events? The web3.js library provides a data structure that contains a transaction’s logs. Within those we can see the events generated by the transaction.\n\n\nLet’s use truffle to run a test transaction on the revised Faucet contract. Follow the instructions in [truffle] to set up a project directory and compile the Faucet code. The source code can be found in the book’s GitHub repository under code/truffle/FaucetEvents.\n\n\n$ truffle develop\ntruffle(develop)> compile\ntruffle(develop)> migrate\nUsing network 'develop'.\n\nRunning migration: 1_initial_migration.js\n  Deploying Migrations...\n  ... 0xb77ceae7c3f5afb7fbe3a6c5974d352aa844f53f955ee7d707ef6f3f8e6b4e61\n  Migrations: 0x8cdaf0cd259887258bc13a92c0a6da92698644c0\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0xd7bc86d31bee32fa3988f1c1eabce403a1b5d570340a3a9cdba53a472ee8c956\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js\n  Deploying Faucet...\n  ... 0xfa850d754314c3fb83f43ca1fa6ee20bc9652d891c00a2f63fd43ab5bfb0d781\n  Faucet: 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0xf36163615f41ef7ed8f4a8f192149a0bf633fe1a2398ce001bf44c43dc7bdda0\nSaving artifacts...\n\ntruffle(develop)> Faucet.deployed().then(i => {FaucetDeployed = i})\ntruffle(develop)> FaucetDeployed.send(web3.toWei(1, \"ether\")).then(res => \\\n                  { console.log(res.logs[0].event, res.logs[0].args) })\nDeposit { from: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  amount: BigNumber { s: 1, e: 18, c: [ 10000 ] } }\ntruffle(develop)> FaucetDeployed.withdraw(web3.toWei(0.1, \"ether\")).then(res => \\\n                  { console.log(res.logs[0].event, res.logs[0].args) })\nWithdrawal { to: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  amount: BigNumber { s: 1, e: 17, c: [ 1000 ] } }\n\n\nAfter deploying the contract using the deployed function, we execute two transactions. The first transaction is a deposit (using send), which emits a Deposit event in the transaction logs:\n\n\n\nDeposit { from: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  amount: BigNumber { s: 1, e: 18, c: [ 10000 ] } }\n\n\n\nNext, we use the withdraw function to make a withdrawal. This emits a Withdrawal event:\n\n\n\nWithdrawal { to: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  amount: BigNumber { s: 1, e: 17, c: [ 1000 ] } }\n\n\n\nTo get these events, we looked at the logs array returned as a result (res) of the transactions. The first log entry (logs[0]) contains an event name in logs[0].event and the event arguments in logs[0].args. By showing these on the console, we can see the emitted event name and the event arguments.\n\n\nEvents are a very useful mechanism, not only for intra-contract communication, but also for debugging during development.\n\n\n\n\nCalling Other Contracts (send, call, callcode, delegatecall)\n\nCalling other contracts from within your contract is a very useful but potentially dangerous operation. We’ll examine the various ways you can achieve this and evaluate the risks of each method. In short, the risks arise from the fact that you may not know much about a contract you are calling into or that is calling into your contract. When writing smart contracts, you must keep in mind that while you may mostly expect to be dealing with EOAs, there is nothing to stop arbitrarily complex and perhaps malign contracts from calling into and being called by your code.\n\n\nCreating a new instance\n\nThe safest way to call another contract is if you create that other contract yourself. That way, you are certain of its interfaces and behavior. To do this, you can simply instantiate it, using the keyword new, as in other object-oriented languages. In Solidity, the keyword new will create the contract on the blockchain and return an object that you can use to reference it. Let’s say you want to create and call a Faucet contract from within another contract called Token:\n\n\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tFaucet _faucet;\n\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t_faucet = new Faucet();\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nThis mechanism for contract construction ensures that you know the exact type of the contract and its interface. The contract Faucet must be defined within the scope of Token, which you can do with an import statement if the definition is in another file:\n\n\n\nimport \"Faucet.sol\";\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tFaucet _faucet;\n\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t_faucet = new Faucet();\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nYou can optionally specify the value of ether transfer on creation, and pass arguments to the new contract’s constructor:\n\n\n\nimport \"Faucet.sol\";\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tFaucet _faucet;\n\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t_faucet = (new Faucet).value(0.5 ether)();\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also then call the Faucet functions. In this example, we call the destroy function of Faucet from within the destroy function of Token:\n\n\n\nimport \"Faucet.sol\";\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tFaucet _faucet;\n\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t_faucet = (new Faucet).value(0.5 ether)();\n\t}\n\n\tfunction destroy() ownerOnly {\n\t\t_faucet.destroy();\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nNote that while you are the owner of the Token contract, the Token contract itself owns the new Faucet contract, so only the Token contract can destroy it.\n\n\n\nAddressing an existing instance\n\nAnother way you can call a contract is by casting the address of an existing instance of the contract. With this method, you apply a known interface to an existing instance. It is therefore critically important that you know, for sure, that the instance you are addressing is in fact of the type you assume. Let’s look at an example:\n\n\n\nimport \"Faucet.sol\";\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\n\tFaucet _faucet;\n\n\tconstructor(address _f) {\n\t\t_faucet = Faucet(_f);\n\t\t_faucet.withdraw(0.1 ether)\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nHere, we take an address provided as an argument to the constructor, _f, and we cast it to a Faucet object. This is much riskier than the previous mechanism, because we don’t know for sure whether that address actually is a Faucet object. When we call withdraw, we are assuming that it accepts the same arguments and executes the same code as our Faucet declaration, but we can’t be sure. For all we know, the withdraw function at this address could execute something completely different from what we expect, even if it is named the same. Using addresses passed as input and casting them into specific objects is therefore much more dangerous than creating the contract yourself.\n\n\n\nRaw call, delegatecall\n\nSolidity offers some even more \"low-level\" functions for calling other contracts. These correspond directly to EVM opcodes of the same name and allow us to construct a contract-to-contract call manually. As such, they represent the most flexible and the most dangerous mechanisms for calling other contracts.\n\n\nHere’s the same example, using a call method:\n\n\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tconstructor(address _faucet) {\n\t\t_faucet.call(\"withdraw\", 0.1 ether);\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this type of call is a blind call into a function, very much like constructing a raw transaction, only from within a contract’s context. It can expose your contract to a number of security risks, most importantly reentrancy, which we will discuss in more detail in [reentrancy_security]. The call function will return false if there is a problem, so you can evaluate the return value for error handling:\n\n\n\ncontract Token is mortal {\n\tconstructor(address _faucet) {\n\t\tif !(_faucet.call(\"withdraw\", 0.1 ether)) {\n\t\t\trevert(\"Withdrawal from faucet failed\");\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n\n\nAnother variant of call is delegatecall, which replaced the more dangerous callcode. The callcode method will be deprecated soon, so it should not be used.\n\n\nAs mentioned in address object, a delegatecall is different from a call in that the msg context does not change. For example, whereas a call changes the value of msg.sender to be the calling contract, a delegatecall keeps the same msg.sender as in the calling contract. Essentially, delegatecall runs the code of another contract inside the context of the execution of the current contract. It is most often used to invoke code from a library. It also allows you to draw on the pattern of using library functions stored elsewhere, but have that code work with the storage data of your contract.\n\n\nThe delegate call should be used with great caution. It can have some unexpected effects, especially if the contract you call was not designed as a library.\n\n\nLet’s use an example contract to demonstrate the various call semantics used by call and delegatecall for calling libraries and contracts. In CallExamples.sol: An example of different call semantics, we use an event to log the details of each call and see how the calling context changes depending on the call type.\n\n\nExample 4. CallExamples.sol: An example of different call semantics\n\n\n\nlink:code/truffle/CallExamples/contracts/CallExamples.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in this example, our main contract is caller, which calls a library calledLibrary and a contract calledContract. Both the called library and the contract have identical calledFunction functions, which emit an event calledEvent. The event calledEvent logs three pieces of data: msg.sender, tx.origin, and this. Each time calledFunction is called it may have a different execution context (with different values for potentially all the context variables), depending on whether it is called directly or through delegatecall.\n\n\nIn caller, we first call the contract and library directly, by invoking calledFunction in each. Then, we explicitly use the low-level functions call and delegatecall to call calledContract.calledFunction. This way we can see how the various calling mechanisms behave.\n\n\nLet’s run this in a Truffle development environment and capture the events, to see how it looks:\n\n\ntruffle(develop)> migrate\nUsing network 'develop'.\n[...]\nSaving artifacts...\ntruffle(develop)> web3.eth.accounts[0]\n'0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57'\ntruffle(develop)> caller.address\n'0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f'\ntruffle(develop)> calledContract.address\n'0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10'\ntruffle(develop)> calledLibrary.address\n'0xf25186b5081ff5ce73482ad761db0eb0d25abfbf'\ntruffle(develop)> caller.deployed().then( i => { callerDeployed = i })\n\ntruffle(develop)> callerDeployed.make_calls(calledContract.address).then(res => \\\n                  { res.logs.forEach( log => { console.log(log.args) })})\n{ sender: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f',\n  origin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  from: '0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10' }\n{ sender: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  origin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  from: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f' }\n{ sender: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f',\n  origin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  from: '0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10' }\n{ sender: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  origin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\n  from: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f' }\n\n\nLet’s see what happened here. We called the make_calls function and passed the address of calledContract, then caught the four events emitted by each of the different calls. Let’s look at the make_calls function and walk through each step.\n\n\nThe first call is:\n\n\n\n_calledContract.calledFunction();\n\n\n\nHere, we’re calling calledContract.calledFunction directly, using the high-level ABI for calledFunction. The event emitted is:\n\n\n\nsender: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f',\norigin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\nfrom: '0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10'\n\n\n\nAs you can see, msg.sender is the address of the caller contract. The tx.origin is the address of our account, web3.eth.accounts[0], that sent the transaction to caller. The event was emitted by calledContract, as we can see from the last argument in the event.\n\n\nThe next call in make_calls is to the library:\n\n\n\ncalledLibrary.calledFunction();\n\n\n\nIt looks identical to how we called the contract, but behaves very differently. Let’s look at the second event emitted:\n\n\n\nsender: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\norigin: '0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57',\nfrom: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f'\n\n\n\nThis time, the msg.sender is not the address of caller. Instead, it is the address of our account, and is the same as the transaction origin. That’s because when you call a library, the call is always delegatecall and runs within the context of the caller. So, when the calledLibrary code was running, it inherited the execution context of caller, as if its code was running inside caller. The variable this (shown as from in the event emitted) is the address of caller, even though it is accessed from within calledLibrary.\n\n\nThe next two calls, using the low-level call and delegatecall, verify our expectations, emitting events that mirror what we just saw.\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Considerations\n\nGas, described in more in detail in [gas], is an incredibly important consideration in smart contract programming. Gas is a resource constraining the maximum amount of computation that Ethereum will allow a transaction to consume. If the gas limit is exceeded during computation, the following series of events occurs:\n\n\n\n\nAn \"out of gas\" exception is thrown.\n\n\nThe state of the contract prior to execution is restored (reverted).\n\n\nAll ether used to pay for the gas is taken as a transaction fee; it is not refunded.\n\n\n\n\nBecause gas is paid by the user who initiates the transaction, users are discouraged from calling functions that have a high gas cost. It is thus in the programmer’s best interest to minimize the gas cost of a contract’s functions. To this end, there are certain practices that are recommended when constructing smart contracts, so as to minimize the gas cost of a function call.\n\n\nAvoid Dynamically Sized Arrays\n\nAny loop through a dynamically sized array where a function performs operations on each element or searches for a particular element introduces the risk of using too much gas. Indeed, the contract may run out of gas before finding the desired result, or before acting on every element, thus wasting time and ether without giving any result at all.\n\n\n\nAvoid Calls to Other Contracts\n\nCalling other contracts, especially when the gas cost of their functions is not known, introduces the risk of running out of gas. Avoid using libraries that are not well tested and broadly used. The less scrutiny a library has received from other programmers, the greater the risk of using it.\n\n\n\nEstimating Gas Cost\n\nIf you need to estimate the gas necessary to execute a certain method of a contract considering its arguments, you could use the following procedure:\n\n\n\nvar contract = web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address);\nvar gasEstimate = contract.myAweSomeMethod.estimateGas(arg1, arg2,\n    {from: account});\n\n\n\ngasEstimate will tell you the number of gas units needed for its execution. It is an estimate because of the Turing completeness of the EVM—it is relatively trivial to create a function that will take vastly different amounts of gas to execute different calls. Even production code can change execution paths in subtle ways, resulting in hugely different gas costs from one call to the next. However, most functions are sensible and estimateGas will give a good estimate most of the time.\n\n\nTo obtain the gas price from the network you can use:\n\n\n\nvar gasPrice = web3.eth.getGasPrice();\n\n\n\nAnd from there you can estimate the gas cost:\n\n\n\nvar gasCostInEther = web3.fromWei((gasEstimate * gasPrice), 'ether');\n\n\n\nLet’s apply our gas estimation functions to estimating the gas cost of our Faucet example, using the code from the book’s repository.\n\n\nStart Truffle in development mode and execute the JavaScript file in gas_estimates.js: Using the estimateGas function, gas_estimates.js.\n\n\nExample 5. gas_estimates.js: Using the estimateGas function\n\n\n\nvar FaucetContract = artifacts.require(\"./Faucet.sol\");\n\nFaucetContract.web3.eth.getGasPrice(function(error, result) {\n    var gasPrice = Number(result);\n    console.log(\"Gas Price is \" + gasPrice + \" wei\"); // \"10000000000000\"\n\n    // Get the contract instance\n    FaucetContract.deployed().then(function(FaucetContractInstance) {\n\n\t\t// Use the keyword 'estimateGas' after the function name to get the gas\n\t\t// estimation for this particular function (aprove)\n\t\tFaucetContractInstance.send(web3.toWei(1, \"ether\"));\n        return FaucetContractInstance.withdraw.estimateGas(web3.toWei(0.1, \"ether\"));\n\n    }).then(function(result) {\n        var gas = Number(result);\n\n        console.log(\"gas estimation = \" + gas + \" units\");\n        console.log(\"gas cost estimation = \" + (gas * gasPrice) + \" wei\");\n        console.log(\"gas cost estimation = \" +\n                FaucetContract.web3.fromWei((gas * gasPrice), 'ether') + \" ether\");\n    });\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how that looks in the Truffle development console:\n\n\n$ truffle develop\n\ntruffle(develop)> exec gas_estimates.js\nUsing network 'develop'.\n\nGas Price is 20000000000 wei\ngas estimation = 31397 units\ngas cost estimation = 627940000000000 wei\ngas cost estimation = 0.00062794 ether\n\n\nIt is recommended that you evaluate the gas cost of functions as part of your development workflow, to avoid any surprises when deploying contracts to the mainnet.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we started working with smart contracts in detail and explored the Solidity contract programming language. We took a simple example contract, Faucet.sol, and gradually improved it and made it more complex, using it to explore various aspects of the Solidity language. In [vyper_chap] we will work with Vyper, another contract-oriented programming language. We will compare Vyper to Solidity, showing some of the differences in the design of these two languages and deepening our understanding of smart contract programming.\n\n\n\n"},"08smart-contracts-vyper.html":{"url":"08smart-contracts-vyper.html","title":"Chapter 8: Smart Contracts and Vyper","keywords":"","body":"\nSmart Contracts and Vyper\n\n\nVyper is an experimental, contract-oriented programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine that strives to provide superior auditability, by making it easier for developers to produce intelligible code. In fact, one of the principles of Vyper is to make it virtually impossible for developers to write misleading code.\n\n\nIn this chapter we will look at common problems with smart contracts, introduce the Vyper contract programming language, and compare it to Solidity, demonstrating the differences.\n\n\nVulnerabilities and Vyper\n\nA recent study analyzed nearly one million deployed Ethereum smart contracts and found that many of these contracts contained serious vulnerabilities. During their analysis, the researchers outlined three basic categories of trace vulnerabilities:\n\n\n\nSuicidal contracts\n\nSmart contracts that can be killed by arbitrary addresses\n\nGreedy contracts\n\nSmart contracts that can reach a state in which they cannot release ether\n\nProdigal contracts\n\nSmart contracts that can be made to release ether to arbitrary addresses\n\n\n\n\nVulnerabilities are introduced into smart contracts via code. It may be strongly argued that these and other vulnerabilities are not intentionally introduced, but regardless, undesirable smart contract code evidently results in the unexpected loss of funds for Ethereum users, and this is not ideal. Vyper is designed to make it easier to write secure code, or equally to make it more difficult to accidentally write misleading or vulnerable code.\n\n\n\nComparison to Solidity\n\nOne of the ways in which Vyper tries to make unsafe code harder to write is by deliberately omitting some of Solidity’s features. It is important for those considering developing smart contracts in Vyper to understand what features Vyper does not have, and why. Therefore, in this section, we will explore those features and provide justification for why they have been omitted.\n\n\nModifiers\n\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, in Solidity you can write a function using modifiers. For example, the following function, changeOwner, will run the code in a modifier called onlyBy as part of its execution:\n\n\n\nfunction changeOwner(address _newOwner)\n    public\n    onlyBy(owner)\n{\n    owner = _newOwner;\n}\n\n\n\nThis modifier enforces a rule in relation to ownership. As you can see, this particular modifier acts as a mechanism to perform a pre-check on behalf of the changeOwner function:\n\n\n\nmodifier onlyBy(address _account)\n{\n    require(msg.sender == _account);\n    _;\n}\n\n\n\nBut modifiers are not just there to perform checks, as shown here. In fact, as modifiers, they can significantly change a smart contract’s environment, in the context of the calling function. Put simply, modifiers are pervasive.\n\n\nLet’s look at another Solidity-style example:\n\n\n\nenum Stages {\n    SafeStage\n    DangerStage,\n    FinalStage\n}\n\nuint public creationTime = now;\nStages public stage = Stages.SafeStage;\n\nfunction nextStage() internal {\n    stage = Stages(uint(stage) + 1);\n}\n\nmodifier stageTimeConfirmation() {\n    if (stage == Stages.SafeStage &&\n                now >= creationTime + 10 days)\n        nextStage();\n    _;\n}\n\nfunction a()\n    public\n    stageTimeConfirmation\n    // More code goes here\n{\n}\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, developers should always check any other code that their own code is calling. However, it is possible that in certain situations (like when time constraints or exhaustion result in lack of concentration) a developer may overlook a single line of code. This is even more likely if the developer has to jump around inside a large file while mentally keeping track of the function call hierarchy and committing the state of smart contract variables to memory.\n\n\nLet’s look at the preceding example in a bit more depth. Imagine that a developer is writing a public function called a. The developer is new to this contract and is utilizing a modifier written by someone else. At a glance, it appears that the stageTimeConfirmation modifier is simply performing some checks regarding the age of the contract in relation to the calling function. What the developer may not realize is that the modifier is also calling another function, nextStage. In this simplistic demonstration scenario, simply calling the public function a results in the smart contract’s stage variable moving from SafeStage to DangerStage.\n\n\nVyper has done away with modifiers altogether. The recommendations from Vyper are as follows: if only performing assertions with modifiers, then simply use inline checks and asserts as part of the function; if modifying smart contract state and so forth, again make these changes explicitly part of the function. Doing this improves auditability and readability, as the reader doesn’t have to mentally (or manually) \"wrap\" the modifier code around the function to see what it does.\n\n\n\nClass Inheritance\n\nInheritance allows programmers to harness the power of prewritten code by acquiring preexisting functionality, properties, and behaviors from existing software libraries. Inheritance is powerful and promotes the reuse of code. Solidity supports multiple inheritance as well as polymorphism, but while these are key features of object-oriented programming, Vyper does not support them. Vyper maintains that the implementation of inheritance requires coders and auditors to jump between multiple files in order to understand what the program is doing. Vyper also takes the view that multiple inheritance can make code too complicated to understand—a view tacitly admitted by the Solidity documentation, which gives an example of how multiple inheritance can be problematic.\n\n\n\nInline Assembly\n\nInline assembly gives developers low-level access to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing Solidity programs to perform operations by directly accessing EVM instructions. For example, the following inline assembly code adds 3 to memory location 0x80:\n\n\n\n3 0x80 mload add 0x80 mstore\n\n\n\nVyper considers the loss of readability to be too high a price to pay for the extra power, and thus does not support inline assembly.\n\n\n\nFunction Overloading\n\nFunction overloading allows developers to write multiple functions of the same name. Which function is used on a given occasion depends on the types of the arguments supplied. Take the following two functions, for example:\n\n\n\nfunction f(uint _in) public pure returns (uint out) {\n    out = 1;\n}\n\nfunction f(uint _in, bytes32 _key) public pure returns (uint out) {\n    out = 2;\n}\n\n\n\nThe first function (named f) accepts an input argument of type uint; the second function (also named f) accepts two arguments, one of type uint and one of type bytes32. Having multiple function definitions with the same name taking different arguments can be confusing, so Vyper does not support function overloading.\n\n\n\nVariable Typecasting\n\nThere are two sorts of typecasting: implicit and explicit\n\n\nImplicit typecasting is often performed at compile time. For example, if a type conversion is semantically sound and no information is likely to be lost, the compiler can perform an implicit conversion, such as converting a variable of type uint8 to uint16. The earliest versions of Vyper allowed implicit typecasting of variables, but recent versions do not.\n\n\nExplicit typecasts can be inserted in Solidity. Unfortunately, they can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, casting a uint32 to the smaller type uint16 simply removes the higher-order bits, as demonstrated here:\n\n\n\nuint32 a = 0x12345678;\nuint16 b = uint16(a);\n// Variable b is 0x5678 now\n\n\n\nVyper instead has a convert function to perform explicit casts. The convert function (found on line 82 of convert.py):\n\n\n\ndef convert(expr, context):\n    output_type = expr.args[1].s\n    if output_type in conversion_table:\n        return conversion_table[output_type](expr, context)\n    else:\n        raise Exception(\"Conversion to {} is invalid.\".format(output_type))\n\n\n\nNote the use of conversion_table (found on line 90 of the same file), which looks like this:\n\n\n\nconversion_table = {\n    'int128': to_int128,\n    'uint256': to_unint256,\n    'decimal': to_decimal,\n    'bytes32': to_bytes32,\n}\n\n\n\nWhen a developer calls convert, it references conversion_table, which ensures that the appropriate conversion is performed. For example, if a developer passes an int128 to the convert function, the to_int128 function on line 26 of the same (convert.py) file will be executed. The to_int128 function is as follows:\n\n\n\n@signature(('int128', 'uint256', 'bytes32', 'bytes'), 'str_literal')\ndef to_int128(expr, args, kwargs, context):\n    in_node = args[0]\n    typ, len = get_type(in_node)\n    if typ in ('int128', 'uint256', 'bytes32'):\n        if in_node.typ.is_literal\n            and not SizeLimits.MINNUM \n\n\n\nAs you can see, the conversion process ensures that no information can be lost; if it could be, an exception is raised. The conversion code prevents truncation as well as other anomalies that would ordinarily be allowed by implicit typecasting.\n\n\nChoosing explicit over implicit typecasting means that the developer is responsible for performing all casts. While this approach does produce more verbose code, it also improves the safety and auditability of smart contracts.\n\n\n\nPreconditions and Postconditions\n\nVyper handles preconditions, postconditions, and state changes explicitly. While this produces redundant code, it also allows for maximal readability and safety. When writing a smart contract in Vyper, a developer should observe the following three points:\n\n\n\nCondition\n\nWhat is the current state/condition of the Ethereum state variables?\n\nEffects\n\nWhat effects will this smart contract code have on the condition of the state variables upon execution? That is, what will be affected, and what will not be affected? Are these effects congruent with the smart contract’s intentions?\n\nInteraction\n\nAfter the first two considerations have been exhaustively dealt with, it is time to run the code. Before deployment, logically step through the code and consider all of the possible permanent outcomes, consequences, and scenarios of executing the code, including interactions with other contracts.\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, each of these points should be carefully considered and then thoroughly documented in the code. Doing so will improve the design of the code, ultimately making it more readable and auditable.\n\n\n\n\nDecorators\n\nThe following decorators may be used at the start of each function:\n\n\n\n@private\n\nThe @private decorator makes the function inaccessible from outside the contract.\n\n@public\n\nThe @public decorator makes the function both visible and executable publicly. For example, even the Ethereum wallet will display such functions when viewing the contract.\n\n@constant\n\nFunctions with the @constant decorator are not allowed to change state variables. In fact, the compiler will reject the entire program (with an appropriate error) if the function tries to change a state variable.\n\n@payable\n\nOnly functions with the @payable decorator are allowed to transfer value.\n\n\n\n\nVyper implements the logic of decorators explicitly. For example, the Vyper compilation process will fail if a function has both a @payable decorator and a @constant decorator. This makes sense because a function that transfers value has by definition updated the state, so cannot be @constant. Each Vyper function must be decorated with either @public or @private (but not both!).\n\n\n\nFunction and Variable Ordering\n\nEach individual Vyper smart contract consists of a single Vyper file only. In other words, all of a given Vyper smart contract’s code, including all functions, variables, and so forth, exists in one place. Vyper requires that each smart contract’s function and variable declarations are physically written in a particular order. Solidity does not have this requirement at all. Let’s take a quick look at a Solidity example:\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.0;\n\ncontract ordering {\n\n    function topFunction()\n    external\n    returns (bool) {\n        initiatizedBelowTopFunction = this.lowerFunction();\n        return initiatizedBelowTopFunction;\n    }\n\n    bool initiatizedBelowTopFunction;\n    bool lowerFunctionVar;\n\n    function lowerFunction()\n    external\n    returns (bool) {\n        lowerFunctionVar = true;\n        return lowerFunctionVar;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example, the function called topFunction is calling another function, lowerFunction. topFunction is also assigning a value to a variable called initiatizedBelowTopFunction. As you can see, Solidity does not require these functions and variables to be physically declared before being called upon by the excecuting code. This is valid Solidity code that will compile successfully.\n\n\nVyper’s ordering requirements are not a new thing; in fact, these ordering requirements have always been present in Python programming. The ordering required by Vyper is straightforward and logical, as illustrated in this next example:\n\n\n\n# Declare a variable called theBool\ntheBool: public(bool)\n\n# Declare a function called topFunction\n@public\ndef topFunction() -> bool:\n    # Assign a value to the already declared function called theBool\n    self.theBool = True\n    return self.theBool\n\n# Declare a function called lowerFunction\n@public\ndef lowerFunction():\n    # Call the already declared function called topFunction\n    assert self.topFunction()\n\n\n\nThis shows the correct ordering of functions and variables in a Vyper smart contract. Note how the variable theBool and the function topFunction are declared before they are assigned a value and called, respectively. If theBool was declared below topFunction or if topFunction was declared below lowerFunction this contract would not compile.\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\nVyper has its own online code editor and compiler, which allows you to write and then compile your smart contracts into bytecode, ABI, and LLL using only your web browser. The Vyper online compiler has a variety of prewritten smart contracts for your convenience, including contracts for a simple open auction, safe remote purchases, ERC20 tokens, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVyper implements ERC20 as a precompiled contract, allowing these smart contracts to be easily used out of the box. Contracts in Vyper must be declared as global variables. An example for declaring the ERC20 variable is as follows:\n\n\n\ntoken: address(ERC20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also compile a contract using the command line. Each Vyper contract is saved in a single file with the .vy extension.\nOnce installed, you can compile a contract with Vyper by running the following command:\n\n\n\nvyper ~/hello_world.vy\n\n\n\nThe human-readable ABI description (in JSON format) can then be obtained by running the following command:\n\n\n\nvyper -f json ~/hello_world.v.py\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Against Overflow Errors at the Compiler Level\n\nOverflow errors in software can be catastrophic when dealing with real value. For example, one transaction from mid-April 2018 shows the  malicious transfer of over 57,896,044,618,658,100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000 BEC tokens. This transaction was the result of an integer overflow issue in BeautyChain’s ERC20 token contract (BecToken.sol). Solidity developers do have access to libraries like SafeMath as well as Ethereum smart contract security analysis tools like Mythril OSS. However, developers are not forced to use the safety tools. Put simply, if safety is not enforced by the language, developers can write unsafe code that will successfully compile and later on \"successfully\" execute.\n\n\nVyper has built-in overflow protection, implemented in a two-pronged approach. Firstly, Vyper provides a SafeMath equivalent that includes the necessary exception cases for integer arithmetic. Secondly, Vyper uses clamps whenever a literal constant is loaded, a value is passed to a function, or a variable is assigned. Clamps are implemented via custom functions in the Low-level Lisp-like Language (LLL) compiler, and cannot be disabled. (The Vyper compiler outputs LLL rather than EVM bytecode; this simplifies the development of Vyper itself.)\n\n\n\nReading and Writing Data\n\nWhile it is costly to store, read, and modify data, these storage operations are a necessary component of most smart contracts. Smart contracts can write data to two places:\n\n\n\nGlobal state\n\nThe state variables in a given smart contract are stored in Ethereum’s global state trie; a smart contract can only store, read, and modify data in relation to that particular contract’s address (i.e., smart contracts cannot read or write to other smart contracts).\n\nLogs\n\nA smart contract can also write to Ethereum’s chain data through log events. While Vyper initially employed the __log__ syntax for declaring these events, an update has been made that brings its event declaration more in line with Solidity’s original syntax. For example, Vyper’s declaration of an event called MyLog was originally MyLog: __log__({arg1: indexed(bytes[3])}). The syntax has now become MyLog: event({arg1: indexed(bytes[3])}). It is important to note that the execution of the log event in Vyper was, and still is, as follows: log.MyLog(\"123\").\n\n\n\n\nWhile smart contracts can write to Ethereum’s chain data (through log events), they are unable to read the on-chain log events they’ve created. Notwithstanding, one of the advantages of writing to Ethereum’s chain data via log events is that logs can be discovered and read, on the public chain, by light clients. For example, the logsBloom value in a mined block can indicate whether or not a log event is present. Once the existence of log events has been established, the log data can be obtained from a given transaction receipt.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nVyper is a powerful and interesting new contract-oriented programming language. Its design is biased toward \"correctness,\" at the expense of some flexibility. This may allow programmers to write better smart contracts and avoid certain pitfalls that cause serious vulnerabilities to arise. Next, we will look at smart contract security in more detail. Some of the nuances of Vyper design may become more apparent once you read about all the possible security problems that can arise in smart contracts.\n\n\n\n"},"09smart-contracts-security.html":{"url":"09smart-contracts-security.html","title":"Chapter 9: Smart Contract Security","keywords":"","body":"\nSmart Contract Security\n\n\nSecurity is one of the most important considerations when writing smart contracts. In the field of smart contract programming, mistakes are costly and easily exploited. In this chapter we will look at security best practices and design patterns, as well as \"security antipatterns,\" which are practices and patterns that can introduce vulnerabilities in our smart contracts.\n\n\nAs with other programs, a smart contract will execute exactly what is written, which is not always what the programmer intended. Furthermore, all smart contracts are public, and any user can interact with them simply by creating a transaction. Any vulnerability can be exploited, and losses are almost always impossible to recover. It is therefore critical to follow best practices and use well-tested design patterns.\n\n\nSecurity Best Practices\n\nDefensive programming is a style of programming that is particularly well suited to smart contracts. It emphasizes the following, all of which are best practices:\n\n\n\nMinimalism/simplicity\n\nComplexity is the enemy of security. The simpler the code, and the less it does, the lower the chances are of a bug or unforeseen effect occurring. When first engaging in smart contract programming, developers are often tempted to try to write a lot of code. Instead, you should look through your smart contract code and try to find ways to do less, with fewer lines of code, less complexity, and fewer \"features.\" If someone tells you that their project has produced \"thousands of lines of code\" for their smart contracts, you should question the security of that project. Simpler is more secure.\n\nCode reuse\n\nTry not to reinvent the wheel. If a library or contract already exists that does most of what you need, reuse it. Within your own code, follow the DRY principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. If you see any snippet of code repeated more than once, ask yourself whether it could be written as a function or library and reused. Code that has been extensively used and tested is likely more secure than any new code you write. Beware of “Not Invented Here” syndrome, where you are tempted to \"improve\" a feature or component by building it from scratch. The security risk is often greater than the improvement value.\n\nCode quality\n\nSmart contract code is unforgiving. Every bug can lead to monetary loss. You should not treat smart contract programming the same way as general-purpose programming. Writing DApps in Solidity is not like creating a web widget in JavaScript. Rather, you should apply rigorous engineering and software development methodologies, as you would in aerospace engineering or any similarly unforgiving discipline. Once you \"launch\" your code, there’s little you can do to fix any problems.\n\nReadability/auditability\n\nYour code should be clear and easy to comprehend. The easier it is to read, the easier it is to audit. Smart contracts are public, as everyone can read the bytecode and anyone can reverse-engineer it. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop your work in public, using collaborative and open source methodologies, to draw upon the collective wisdom of the developer community and benefit from the highest common denominator of open source development. You should write code that is well documented and easy to read, following the style and naming conventions that are part of the Ethereum community.\n\nTest coverage\n\nTest everything that you can. Smart contracts run in a public execution environment, where anyone can execute them with whatever input they want. You should never assume that input, such as function arguments, is well formed, properly bounded, or has a benign purpose. Test all arguments to make sure they are within expected ranges and properly formatted before allowing execution of your code to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Risks and Antipatterns\n\nAs a smart contract programmer, you should be familiar with the most common security risks, so as to be able to detect and avoid the programming patterns that leave your contracts exposed to these risks. In the next several sections we will look at different security risks, examples of how vulnerabilities can arise, and countermeasures or preventative solutions that can be used to address them.\n\n\n\nReentrancy\n\nOne of the features of Ethereum smart contracts is their ability to call\nand utilize code from other external contracts. Contracts also typically\nhandle ether, and as such often send ether to various external user\naddresses. These operations require the contracts to submit external calls. These\nexternal calls can be hijacked by attackers, who can force the\ncontracts to execute further code (through a fallback function),\nincluding calls back into themselves. Attacks of this kind were used in the\ninfamous DAO hack.\n\n\nFor further reading on reentrancy attacks, see Gus Guimareas’s blog post on the subject and the Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nThis type of attack can occur when a contract sends ether to an unknown address.\nAn attacker can carefully construct a contract at an external address\nthat contains malicious code in the fallback function. Thus, when a contract sends ether to this address, it will\ninvoke the malicious code. Typically the malicious code executes a\nfunction on the vulnerable contract, performing operations not expected\nby the developer. The term \"reentrancy\" comes from the fact that the\nexternal malicious contract calls a function on the vulnerable\ncontract and the path of code execution “reenters” it.\n\n\nTo clarify this, consider the simple vulnerable contract in EtherStore.sol, which acts as\nan Ethereum vault that allows depositors to withdraw only 1 ether per\nweek.\n\n\nExample 1. EtherStore.sol\n\n\n\ncontract EtherStore {\n\n    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public lastWithdrawTime;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function depositFunds() public payable {\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);\n        // limit the withdrawal\n        require(_weiToWithdraw = lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);\n        require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;\n        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;\n    }\n }\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract has two public functions, depositFunds and\nwithdrawFunds. The depositFunds function simply increments the\nsender’s balance. The withdrawFunds function allows the sender to\nspecify the amount of wei to withdraw. This function is intended to succeed\nonly if the requested amount to withdraw is less than 1 ether and a withdrawal\nhas not occurred in the last week.\n\n\nThe vulnerability is in line 17, where the contract sends the user their\nrequested amount of ether. Consider an attacker who has created the contract in Attack.sol.\n\n\nExample 2. Attack.sol\n\n\n\nimport \"EtherStore.sol\";\n\ncontract Attack {\n  EtherStore public etherStore;\n\n  // intialize the etherStore variable with the contract address\n  constructor(address _etherStoreAddress) {\n      etherStore = EtherStore(_etherStoreAddress);\n  }\n\n  function attackEtherStore() public payable {\n      // attack to the nearest ether\n      require(msg.value >= 1 ether);\n      // send eth to the depositFunds() function\n      etherStore.depositFunds.value(1 ether)();\n      // start the magic\n      etherStore.withdrawFunds(1 ether);\n  }\n\n  function collectEther() public {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n\n  // fallback function - where the magic happens\n  function () payable {\n      if (etherStore.balance > 1 ether) {\n          etherStore.withdrawFunds(1 ether);\n      }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might the exploit occur? First, the attacker would create the malicious contract (let’s say at the\naddress 0x0…​123) with the EtherStore’s contract address as the sole\nconstructor parameter. This would initialize and point the public\nvariable etherStore to the contract to be attacked.\n\n\nThe attacker would then call the attackEtherStore function, with some\namount of ether greater than or equal to 1—let’s assume 1 ether for\nthe time being. In this example, we will also assume a number of other users have\ndeposited ether into this contract, such that its current balance is\n10 ether. The following will then occur:\n\n\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 15: The depositFunds function of the EtherStore\ncontract will be called with a msg.value of 1 ether (and a lot of gas). The\nsender (msg.sender) will be the malicious contract (0x0…​123). Thus,\n       balances[0x0..123] = 1 ether.\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 17: The malicious contract will then call the\nwithdrawFunds function of the EtherStore contract with a parameter of 1\nether. This will pass all the requirements (lines 12–16 of the\n    EtherStore contract) as no previous withdrawals have been made.\n\n\nEtherStore.sol, line 17: The contract will send 1 ether back to\nthe malicious contract.\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 25: The payment to the malicious contract will\nthen execute the fallback function.\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 26: The total balance of the EtherStore contract was\n10 ether and is now 9 ether, so this if statement passes.\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 27: The fallback function calls the EtherStore\nwithdrawFunds function again and 'reenters' the EtherStore\ncontract.\n\n\nEtherStore.sol, line 11: In this second call to withdrawFunds, the\nattacking contract’s balance is still 1 ether as line 18 has not yet been executed. Thus, we\nstill have balances[0x0..123] = 1 ether. This is also the case for the\nlastWithdrawTime variable. Again, we pass all the requirements.\n\n\nEtherStore.sol, line 17: The attacking contract withdraws another 1 ether.\n\n\nSteps 4–8 repeat until it is no longer the case that EtherStore.balance > 1, as dictated by line 26 in Attack.sol.\n\n\nAttack.sol, line 26: Once there is 1 (or less) ether left in the EtherStore contract, this if statement will fail. This will then allow lines 18 and 19 of the EtherStore contract to be executed (for each call to the withdrawFunds function).\n\n\nEtherStore.sol, lines 18 and 19: The balances and\nlastWithdrawTime mappings will be set and the execution will end.\n\n\n\n\nThe final result is that the attacker has withdrawn all but 1 ether\nfrom the EtherStore contract in a single transaction.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThere are a number of common techniques that help avoid potential\nreentrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The first is to (whenever possible) use the built-in\ntransfer\nfunction when sending ether to external contracts. The transfer function\nonly sends 2300 gas with the external call, which is not enough for the destination\naddress/contract to call another contract (i.e., reenter the sending\ncontract).\n\n\nThe second technique is to ensure that all logic that changes state\nvariables happens before ether is sent out of the contract (or any\nexternal call). In the EtherStore example, lines 18 and 19 of\nEtherStore.sol should be put before line 17. It is good practice for any code that performs external calls to unknown addresses to be the\nlast operation in a localized function or piece of code execution. This\nis known as the\nchecks-effects-interactions\npattern.\n\n\nA third technique is to introduce a mutex—that is, to add a state\nvariable that locks the contract during code execution, preventing\nreentrant calls.\n\n\nApplying all of these techniques (using all three is unnecessary, but we do it\nfor demonstrative purposes) to EtherStore.sol, gives the\nreentrancy-free contract:\n\n\n\ncontract EtherStore {\n\n    // initialize the mutex\n    bool reEntrancyMutex = false;\n    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public lastWithdrawTime;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n\n    function depositFunds() public payable {\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {\n        require(!reEntrancyMutex);\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);\n        // limit the withdrawal\n        require(_weiToWithdraw = lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;\n        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;\n        // set the reEntrancy mutex before the external call\n        reEntrancyMutex = true;\n        msg.sender.transfer(_weiToWithdraw);\n        // release the mutex after the external call\n        reEntrancyMutex = false;\n    }\n }\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: The DAO\n\nThe DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) attack was one of the major hacks that\noccurred in the early development of Ethereum. At the time, the contract\nheld over $150 million. Reentrancy played a major role in the\nattack, which ultimately led to the hard fork that created Ethereum\nClassic (ETC). For a good analysis of the DAO exploit, see\nhttp://bit.ly/2EQaLCI. More information on Ethereum’s fork history, the DAO hack timeline, and the birth of ETC in a hard fork can be found in [ethereum_standards].\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic Over/Underflows\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine specifies fixed-size data types for\nintegers. This means that an integer variable can represent only a certain range\nof numbers. A uint8, for example, can only store\nnumbers in the range [0,255]. Trying to store 256 into a uint8 will\nresult in 0. If care is not taken, variables in Solidity can be\nexploited if user input is unchecked and calculations are performed\nthat result in numbers that lie outside the range of the data type that\nstores them.\n\n\nFor further reading on arithmetic over/underflows, see “How to Secure Your Smart Contracts”,\nEthereum Smart Contract Best Practices, and\n“Ethereum, Solidity and integer overflows: programming blockchains like 1970”.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nAn over/underflow occurs when an operation is performed that requires a\nfixed-size variable to store a number (or piece of data) that is outside\nthe range of the variable’s data type.\n\n\nFor example, subtracting 1 from a uint8 (unsigned integer of 8 bits; i.e., nonnegative) variable whose value is 0 will result\nin the number 255. This is an underflow. We have assigned a number\nbelow the range of the uint8, so the result wraps around and gives the\nlargest number a uint8 can store. Similarly, adding 2^8=256 to a\nuint8 will leave the variable unchanged, as we have wrapped around the\nentire length of the uint. Two simple analogies of this behavior are\nodometers in cars, which measure distance traveled (they reset to 000000, after\nthe largest number, i.e., 999999, is surpassed) and periodic mathematical functions\n(adding 2π to the argument of sin leaves the value unchanged).\n\n\nAdding numbers larger than the data type’s range is called an overflow. For\nclarity, adding 257 to a uint8 that currently has a value of 0 will result\nin the number 1.  It is sometimes instructive to think of fixed-size variables\nas being cyclic, where we start again from zero if we add numbers above the\nlargest possible stored number, and start counting down from the largest number if we subtract from zero. In the case of signed int types, which can represent negative numbers, we start again once we reach the largest negative value; for example, if we try to subtract 1 from a uint8 whose value is -128, we will get 127.\n\n\nThese kinds of numerical gotchas allow attackers to misuse code and create\nunexpected logic flows. For example, consider the TimeLock contract in\nTimeLock.sol.\n\n\nExample 3. TimeLock.sol\n\n\n\ncontract TimeLock {\n\n    mapping(address => uint) public balances;\n    mapping(address => uint) public lockTime;\n\n    function deposit() public payable {\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        lockTime[msg.sender] = now + 1 weeks;\n    }\n\n    function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {\n        lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);\n        require(now > lockTime[msg.sender]);\n        balances[msg.sender] = 0;\n        msg.sender.transfer(balance);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract is designed to act like a time vault: users can\ndeposit ether into the contract and it will be locked there for at least\na week. The user may extend the wait time to longer than 1 week if they choose,\nbut once deposited, the user can be sure their ether is locked in safely\nfor at least a week—or so this contract intends.\n\n\nIn the event that a user is forced to hand over their private key, a contract such as\nthis might be handy to ensure their ether is unobtainable for a short period of time. But if\na user had locked in 100 ether in this contract and handed their keys over to\nan attacker, the attacker could use an overflow to receive the ether, regardless\nof the lockTime.\n\n\nThe attacker could determine the current lockTime for the address they\nnow hold the key for (it’s a public variable). Let’s call this\nuserLockTime. They could then call the increaseLockTime function and\npass as an argument the number 2^256 - userLockTime. This number would\nbe added to the current userLockTime and cause an overflow, resetting\nlockTime[msg.sender] to 0. The attacker could then simply call the\nwithdraw function to obtain their reward.\n\n\nLet’s look at another example (Underflow vulnerability example from Ethernaut challenge), this one from the Ethernaut challenges.\n\n\nSPOILER ALERT: If you have not yet done the Ethernaut challenges, this\ngives a solution to one of the levels.\n\n\nExample 4. Underflow vulnerability example from Ethernaut challenge\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.18;\n\ncontract Token {\n\n  mapping(address => uint) balances;\n  uint public totalSupply;\n\n  function Token(uint _initialSupply) {\n    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;\n  }\n\n  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {\n    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);\n    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;\n    balances[_to] += _value;\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {\n    return balances[_owner];\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple token contract that employs a transfer function,\nallowing participants to move their tokens around. Can you see the error\nin this contract?\n\n\nThe flaw comes in the transfer function. The require statement on\nline 13 can be bypassed using an underflow. Consider a user with a zero\nbalance. They could call the transfer function with any nonzero\n_value and pass the require statement on line 13. This is because\nbalances[msg.sender] is 0 (and a uint256), so subtracting any\npositive amount (excluding 2^256) will result in a positive number, as described previously. This is also true for line 14,\nwhere the balance will be credited with a positive number. Thus, in this\nexample, an attacker can achieve free tokens due to an underflow vulnerability.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThe current conventional technique to guard against under/overflow\nvulnerabilities is to use or build mathematical libraries that replace\nthe standard math operators addition, subtraction, and multiplication\n(division is excluded as it does not cause over/underflows and the EVM\nreverts on division by 0).\n\n\nOpenZeppelin has\ndone a great job of building and auditing secure libraries for the Ethereum community. In particular, its SafeMath library can be used to avoid under/overflow vulnerabilities.\n\n\nTo demonstrate how these libraries are used in Solidity, let’s correct the TimeLock contract using the SafeMath library. The overflow-free version of the contract is:\n\n\n\nlibrary SafeMath {\n\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    if (a == 0) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    uint256 c = a * b;\n    assert(c / a == b);\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    // assert(b > 0); // Solidity automatically throws when dividing by 0\n    uint256 c = a / b;\n    // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // This holds in all cases\n    return c;\n  }\n\n  function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    assert(b = a);\n    return c;\n  }\n}\n\ncontract TimeLock {\n    using SafeMath for uint; // use the library for uint type\n    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public lockTime;\n\n    function deposit() public payable {\n        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(msg.value);\n        lockTime[msg.sender] = now.add(1 weeks);\n    }\n\n    function increaseLockTime(uint256 _secondsToIncrease) public {\n        lockTime[msg.sender] = lockTime[msg.sender].add(_secondsToIncrease);\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);\n        require(now > lockTime[msg.sender]);\n        balances[msg.sender] = 0;\n        msg.sender.transfer(balance);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nNotice that all standard math operations have been replaced by those\ndefined in the SafeMath library. The TimeLock contract no longer\nperforms any operation that is capable of under/overflow.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples: PoWHC and Batch Transfer Overflow (CVE-2018–10299)\n\nProof of Weak Hands Coin (PoWHC), originally devised as a joke of sorts, was a\nPonzi scheme written by an internet collective. Unfortunately it seems that the author(s) of the contract\nhad not seen over/underflows before, and consequently 866 ether were\nliberated from its contract. Eric Banisadr gives a good overview of how the underflow occurred\n(which is not too dissimilar to the Ethernaut challenge described earlier) in his blog post on the event.\n\n\nAnother example comes from the implementation of a batchTransfer() function into a group of ERC20 token contracts. The implementation contained an overflow vulnerability; you can read about the details in PeckShield’s account.\n\n\n\n\nUnexpected Ether\n\nTypically, when ether is sent to a contract it must execute either the\nfallback function or another function defined in the contract. There\nare two exceptions to this, where ether can exist in a contract without\nhaving executed any code. Contracts that rely on code execution for\nall ether sent to them can be vulnerable to attacks where\nether is forcibly sent.\n\n\nFor further reading on this, see “How to Secure Your Smart Contracts” and “Solidity Security Patterns - Forcing Ether to a Contract”.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nA common defensive programming technique that is useful in enforcing\ncorrect state transitions or validating operations is\ninvariant checking. This technique involves defining a set of\ninvariants (metrics or parameters that should not change) and checking\nthat they remain unchanged after a single (or many) operation(s).\nThis is typically good design, provided the invariants being checked are\nin fact invariants. One example of an invariant is the totalSupply of\na fixed-issuance\nERC20 token. As no function should modify this invariant, one could add a\ncheck to the transfer function that ensures the totalSupply\nremains unmodified, to guarantee the function is working as expected.\n\n\nIn particular, there is one apparent invariant that it may be tempting to use\nbut that can in fact be manipulated by external users (regardless of the rules put\nin place in the smart contract). This is the current ether stored in the\ncontract. Often when developers first learn Solidity they have the\nmisconception that a contract can only accept or obtain ether via payable\nfunctions. This misconception can lead to contracts that have false assumptions\nabout the ether balance within them, which can lead to a range of\nvulnerabilities. The smoking gun for this vulnerability is the (incorrect) use\nof this.balance.\n\n\nThere are two ways in which ether can (forcibly) be sent to a contract\nwithout using a payable function or executing any code on the\ncontract:\n\n\n\nSelf-destruct/suicide\n\nAny contract is able to implement the\nselfdestruct\nfunction, which removes all bytecode from the contract address and sends\nall ether stored there to the parameter-specified address. If this\nspecified address is also a contract, no functions (including the\nfallback) get called. Therefore, the selfdestruct function can be\nused to forcibly send ether to any contract regardless of any code that\nmay exist in the contract, even contracts with no\npayable functions. This means any attacker can create a contract with a\nselfdestruct function, send ether to it, call selfdestruct(target)\nand force ether to be sent to a target contract. Martin Swende has an\nexcellent blog post describing some quirks of the self-destruct opcode (Quirk #2) along with\nan account of how client nodes were checking incorrect invariants,\nwhich could have led to a rather catastrophic crash of the Ethereum network.\n\nPre-sent ether\n\nAnother way to get ether into a contract is to preload the contract address\nwith ether. Contract addresses are deterministic—in fact, the address is\ncalculated from the Keccak-256 (commonly synonymous with SHA-3) hash of the\naddress creating the contract and the transaction nonce that creates the\ncontract. Specifically, it is of the form address = sha3(rlp.encode([account_address,transaction_nonce]))\n(see Adrian Manning’s discussion of “Keyless Ether” for some fun use cases of this). This\nmeans anyone can calculate what a contract’s address will be before it is\ncreated and send ether to that address. When the contract is\ncreated it will have a nonzero ether balance.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore some pitfalls that can arise given this knowledge. Consider the overly simple contract in EtherGame.sol.\n\n\nExample 5. EtherGame.sol\n\n\n\ncontract EtherGame {\n\n    uint public payoutMileStone1 = 3 ether;\n    uint public mileStone1Reward = 2 ether;\n    uint public payoutMileStone2 = 5 ether;\n    uint public mileStone2Reward = 3 ether;\n    uint public finalMileStone = 10 ether;\n    uint public finalReward = 5 ether;\n\n    mapping(address => uint) redeemableEther;\n    // Users pay 0.5 ether. At specific milestones, credit their accounts.\n    function play() public payable {\n        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether); // each play is 0.5 ether\n        uint currentBalance = this.balance + msg.value;\n        // ensure no players after the game has finished\n        require(currentBalance  0);\n        redeemableEther[msg.sender] = 0;\n        msg.sender.transfer(transferValue);\n    }\n }\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract represents a simple game (which would naturally involve\nrace conditions) where players send 0.5 ether to the contract in the hopes of being the player that reaches one of\nthree milestones first. Milestones are denominated in ether. The first\nto reach the milestone may claim a portion of the ether when the game\nhas ended. The game ends when the final milestone (10 ether) is\nreached; users can then claim their rewards.\n\n\nThe issues with the EtherGame contract come from the poor use of\nthis.balance in both lines 14 (and by association 16) and 32. A\nmischievous attacker could forcibly send a small amount of ether—say, 0.1 ether—via the selfdestruct function (discussed earlier) to\nprevent any future players from reaching a milestone. this.balance will never be a multiple of 0.5 ether thanks to this 0.1 ether\ncontribution, because all legitimate players can only send 0.5-ether increments. This prevents all the if conditions on lines 18, 21,\nand 24 from being true.\n\n\nEven worse, a vengeful attacker who missed a milestone could forcibly\nsend 10 ether (or an equivalent amount of ether that pushes the\ncontract’s balance above the finalMileStone), which would lock all\nrewards in the contract forever. This is because the claimReward\nfunction will always revert, due to the require on line 32 (i.e., because\nthis.balance is greater than finalMileStone).\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThis sort of vulnerability typically arises from the misuse of this.balance.\nContract logic, when possible, should avoid being dependent on exact\nvalues of the balance of the contract, because it can be artificially\nmanipulated. If applying logic based on this.balance, you have to\ncope with unexpected balances.\n\n\nIf exact values of deposited ether are required, a self-defined variable\nshould be used that is incremented in payable functions, to safely\ntrack the deposited ether. This variable will not be influenced by the\nforced ether sent via a selfdestruct call.\n\n\nWith this in mind, a corrected version of the EtherGame contract could\nlook like:\n\n\n\ncontract EtherGame {\n\n    uint public payoutMileStone1 = 3 ether;\n    uint public mileStone1Reward = 2 ether;\n    uint public payoutMileStone2 = 5 ether;\n    uint public mileStone2Reward = 3 ether;\n    uint public finalMileStone = 10 ether;\n    uint public finalReward = 5 ether;\n    uint public depositedWei;\n\n    mapping (address => uint) redeemableEther;\n\n    function play() public payable {\n        require(msg.value == 0.5 ether);\n        uint currentBalance = depositedWei + msg.value;\n        // ensure no players after the game has finished\n        require(currentBalance  0);\n        redeemableEther[msg.sender] = 0;\n        msg.sender.transfer(transferValue);\n    }\n }\n\n\n\nHere, we have created a new variable, depositedEther, which keeps\ntrack of the known ether deposited, and it is this variable that we\nuse for our tests. Note that we no longer have any\nreference to this.balance.\n\n\n\nFurther Examples\n\nA few examples of exploitable contracts were given in the\nUnderhanded\nSolidity Coding Contest, which also provides extended examples of a number of the\npitfalls raised in this section.\n\n\n\n\nDELEGATECALL\n\nThe CALL and DELEGATECALL opcodes are useful in allowing Ethereum\ndevelopers to modularize their code. Standard external message calls to\ncontracts are handled by the CALL opcode, whereby code is run in the\ncontext of the external contract/function. The DELEGATECALL opcode is\nalmost identical, except that the code executed at the targeted address is\nrun in the context of the calling contract, and msg.sender and msg.value remain unchanged. This\nfeature enables the implementation of libraries, allowing developers to\ndeploy reusable code once and call it from future contracts.\n\n\nAlthough the differences between these two opcodes are simple and\nintuitive, the use of DELEGATECALL can lead to unexpected code\nexecution.\n\n\nFor further reading, see Loi.Luu’s\nEthereum\nStack Exchange question on this topic and the\nSolidity docs.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nAs a result of the context-preserving nature of DELEGATECALL, building\nvulnerability-free custom libraries is not as easy as one might think.\nThe code in libraries themselves can be secure and vulnerability-free;\nhowever, when run in the context of another application new\nvulnerabilities can arise. Let’s see a fairly complex example of this,\nusing Fibonacci numbers.\n\n\nConsider the library in FibonacciLib.sol, which can generate the Fibonacci sequence\nand sequences of similar form. (Note: this code was\nmodified from https://bit.ly/2MReuii.)\n\n\nExample 6. FibonacciLib.sol\n\n\n\n// library contract - calculates Fibonacci-like numbers\ncontract FibonacciLib {\n    // initializing the standard Fibonacci sequence\n    uint public start;\n    uint public calculatedFibNumber;\n\n    // modify the zeroth number in the sequence\n    function setStart(uint _start) public {\n        start = _start;\n    }\n\n    function setFibonacci(uint n) public {\n        calculatedFibNumber = fibonacci(n);\n    }\n\n    function fibonacci(uint n) internal returns (uint) {\n        if (n == 0) return start;\n        else if (n == 1) return start + 1;\n        else return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis library provides a function that can generate the n-th Fibonacci\nnumber in the sequence. It allows users to change the starting number of the\nsequence (start) and calculate the n-th Fibonacci-like numbers in this new\nsequence.\n\n\nLet us now consider a contract that utilizes this library, shown in FibonacciBalance.sol.\n\n\nExample 7. FibonacciBalance.sol\n\n\n\ncontract FibonacciBalance {\n\n    address public fibonacciLibrary;\n    // the current Fibonacci number to withdraw\n    uint public calculatedFibNumber;\n    // the starting Fibonacci sequence number\n    uint public start = 3;\n    uint public withdrawalCounter;\n    // the Fibonancci function selector\n    bytes4 constant fibSig = bytes4(sha3(\"setFibonacci(uint256)\"));\n\n    // constructor - loads the contract with ether\n    constructor(address _fibonacciLibrary) public payable {\n        fibonacciLibrary = _fibonacciLibrary;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() {\n        withdrawalCounter += 1;\n        // calculate the Fibonacci number for the current withdrawal user-\n        // this sets calculatedFibNumber\n        require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter));\n        msg.sender.transfer(calculatedFibNumber * 1 ether);\n    }\n\n    // allow users to call Fibonacci library functions\n    function() public {\n        require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data));\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract allows a participant to withdraw ether from the contract,\nwith the amount of ether being equal to the Fibonacci number\ncorresponding to the participant’s withdrawal order; i.e., the first\nparticipant gets 1 ether, the second also gets 1, the third gets 2, the\nfourth gets 3, the fifth 5, and so on (until the balance of the contract\nis less than the Fibonacci number being withdrawn).\n\n\nThere are a number of elements in this contract that may require some\nexplanation. Firstly, there is an interesting-looking variable,\nfibSig. This holds the first 4 bytes of the Keccak-256 (SHA-3) hash of the\nstring 'setFibonacci(uint256)'. This is known as the\nfunction\nselector and is put into calldata to specify which function of a\nsmart contract will be called. It is used in the delegatecall function\non line 21 to specify that we wish to run the fibonacci(uint256)\nfunction. The second argument in delegatecall is the parameter we are\npassing to the function. Secondly, we assume that the address for the\nFibonacciLib library is correctly referenced in the constructor\n(External Contract Referencing discusses some\npotential vulnerabilities relating to this kind of contract reference\ninitialization).\n\n\nCan you spot any errors in this contract? If one were to deploy this contract,\nfill it with ether, and call withdraw, it would likely revert.\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the state variable start is used in both the\nlibrary and the main calling contract. In the library contract, start\nis used to specify the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence and is set to\n0, whereas it is set to 3 in the calling contract. You\nmay also have noticed that the fallback function in the\nFibonacciBalance contract allows all calls to be passed to the library\ncontract, which allows for the setStart function of the library\ncontract to be called. Recalling that we preserve the state of the\ncontract, it may seem that this function would allow you to change the\nstate of the start variable in the local FibonnacciBalance contract.\nIf so, this would allow one to withdraw more ether, as the resulting\ncalculatedFibNumber is dependent on the start variable (as seen in\nthe library contract). In actual fact, the setStart function does\nnot (and cannot) modify the start variable in the FibonacciBalance\ncontract. The underlying vulnerability in this contract is significantly\nworse than just modifying the start variable.\n\n\nBefore discussing the actual issue, let’s take a quick detour to\nunderstand how state variables actually get\nstored in contracts. State or storage variables (variables that\npersist over individual transactions) are placed into slots\nsequentially as they are introduced in the contract. (There are some complexities here; consult the Solidity docs for a more thorough understanding.)\n\n\nAs an example, let’s look at the library contract. It has two state\nvariables, start and calculatedFibNumber. The first variable,\nstart, is stored in the contract’s storage at slot[0]\n(i.e., the first slot). The second variable, calculatedFibNumber, is\nplaced in the next available storage slot, slot[1]. The\nfunction setStart takes an input and sets start to whatever\nthe input was. This function therefore sets slot[0] to whatever\ninput we provide in the setStart function. Similarly, the\nsetFibonacci function sets calculatedFibNumber to the result of\nfibonacci(n). Again, this is simply setting storage slot[1] to the\nvalue of fibonacci(n).\n\n\nNow let’s look at the FibonacciBalance contract. Storage slot[0] now\ncorresponds to the fibonacciLibrary address, and slot[1] corresponds to\ncalculatedFibNumber. It is in this incorrect mapping that the vulnerability occurs.\ndelegatecall preserves contract context. This means that code that\nis executed via delegatecall will act on the state (i.e., storage) of\nthe calling contract.\n\n\nNow notice that in withdraw on line 21 we execute\nfibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig,withdrawalCounter). This calls\nthe setFibonacci function, which, as we discussed, modifies storage\nslot[1], which in our current context is calculatedFibNumber. This\nis as expected (i.e., after execution, calculatedFibNumber is\nmodified). However, recall that the start variable in the\nFibonacciLib contract is located in storage slot[0], which is the\nfibonacciLibrary address in the current contract. This means that the\nfunction fibonacci will give an unexpected result. This is because\nit references start (slot[0]), which in the current calling context\nis the fibonacciLibrary address (which will often be quite large, when\ninterpreted as a uint). Thus it is likely that the withdraw\nfunction will revert, as it will not contain uint(fibonacciLibrary)\namount of ether, which is what calculatedFibNumber will return.\n\n\nEven worse, the FibonacciBalance contract allows users to call all of\nthe fibonacciLibrary functions via the fallback function at line 26.\nAs we discussed earlier, this includes the setStart function. We\ndiscussed that this function allows anyone to modify or set storage\nslot[0]. In this case, storage slot[0] is the fibonacciLibrary\naddress. Therefore, an attacker could create a malicious contract, convert the address to a uint (this can be\ndone in Python easily using int('',16)), and then call\nsetStart(). This will change\nfibonacciLibrary to the address of the attack contract. Then, whenever\na user calls withdraw or the fallback function, the malicious\ncontract will run (which can steal the entire balance of the contract)\nbecause we’ve modified the actual address for fibonacciLibrary. An\nexample of such an attack contract would be:\n\n\n\ncontract Attack {\n    uint storageSlot0; // corresponds to fibonacciLibrary\n    uint storageSlot1; // corresponds to calculatedFibNumber\n\n    // fallback - this will run if a specified function is not found\n    function() public {\n        storageSlot1 = 0; // we set calculatedFibNumber to 0, so if withdraw\n        // is called we don't send out any ether\n        .transfer(this.balance); // we take all the ether\n    }\n }\n\n\n\nNotice that this attack contract modifies the calculatedFibNumber by\nchanging storage slot[1]. In principle, an attacker could modify any\nother storage slots they choose, to perform all kinds of attacks on this\ncontract. We encourage you to put these contracts into Remix and experiment with different attack contracts and state changes through these delegatecall functions.\n\n\nIt is also important to notice that when we say that delegatecall is\nstate-preserving, we are not talking about the variable names of the\ncontract, but rather the actual storage slots to which those names point. As\nyou can see from this example, a simple mistake can lead to an attacker\nhijacking the entire contract and its ether.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nSolidity provides the library keyword for implementing library\ncontracts (see the docs for further details). This ensures the library contract is\nstateless and non-self-destructable. Forcing libraries to be stateless\nmitigates the complexities of storage context demonstrated in this\nsection. Stateless libraries also prevent attacks wherein attackers\nmodify the state of the library directly in order to affect the\ncontracts that depend on the library’s code. As a general rule of thumb,\nwhen using DELEGATECALL pay careful attention to the possible calling\ncontext of both the library contract and the calling contract, and\nwhenever possible build stateless libraries.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (Second Hack)\n\nThe Second Parity Multisig Wallet hack is an example of how well-written library code can be exploited if run outside its intended\ncontext. There are a number of good explanations of this hack, such as\n“Parity Multisig Hacked. Again” and “An In-Depth Look at the Parity Multisig Bug”.\n\n\nTo add to these references, let’s explore the contracts that were\nexploited. The library and wallet contracts can be found on GitHub.\n\n\nThe library contract is as follows:\n\n\n\ncontract WalletLibrary is WalletEvents {\n\n  ...\n\n  // throw unless the contract is not yet initialized.\n  modifier only_uninitialized { if (m_numOwners > 0) throw; _; }\n\n  // constructor - just pass on the owner array to multiowned and\n  // the limit to daylimit\n  function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit)\n      only_uninitialized {\n    initDaylimit(_daylimit);\n    initMultiowned(_owners, _required);\n  }\n\n  // kills the contract sending everything to `_to`.\n  function kill(address _to) onlymanyowners(sha3(msg.data)) external {\n    suicide(_to);\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the wallet contract:\n\n\n\ncontract Wallet is WalletEvents {\n\n  ...\n\n  // METHODS\n\n  // gets called when no other function matches\n  function() payable {\n    // just being sent some cash?\n    if (msg.value > 0)\n      Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);\n    else if (msg.data.length > 0)\n      _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  // FIELDS\n  address constant _walletLibrary =\n    0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe;\n}\n\n\n\nNotice that the Wallet contract essentially passes all calls to the\nWalletLibrary contract via a delegate call. The constant\n_walletLibrary address in this code snippet acts as a placeholder for\nthe actually deployed WalletLibrary contract (which was at\n0x863DF6BFa4469f3ead0bE8f9F2AAE51c91A907b4).\n\n\nThe intended operation of these contracts was to have a simple low-cost\ndeployable Wallet contract whose codebase and main functionality were\nin the WalletLibrary contract. Unfortunately, the WalletLibrary\ncontract is itself a contract and maintains its own state. Can you see\nwhy this might be an issue?\n\n\nIt is possible to send calls to the WalletLibrary contract itself.\nSpecifically, the WalletLibrary contract could be initialized and\nbecome owned. In fact, a user did this, calling the initWallet function on the\nWalletLibrary contract and becoming an owner of the library contract. The\nsame user subsequently called the kill function. Because the user\nwas an owner of the library contract, the modifier passed and the\nlibrary contract self-destructed. As all Wallet contracts in existence refer\nto this library contract and contain no method to change this reference,\nall of their functionality, including the ability to withdraw ether, was\nlost along with the WalletLibrary contract. As a result, all ether\nin all Parity multisig wallets of this type instantly became lost or\npermanently unrecoverable.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Visibilities\n\nFunctions in Solidity have visibility specifiers that dictate how\nthey can be called. The visibility determines whether a\nfunction can be called externally by users, by other derived contracts,\nonly internally, or only externally. There are four visibility\nspecifiers, which are described in detail in the Solidity docs. Functions default to public, allowing users to call them\nexternally. We shall now see how incorrect use of visibility specifiers can lead to some devastating vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nThe default visibility for functions is public, so functions\nthat do not specify their visibility will be callable by external users.\nThe issue arises when developers mistakenly omit visibility specifiers\non functions that should be private (or only callable within the\ncontract itself).\n\n\nLet’s quickly explore a trivial example:\n\n\n\ncontract HashForEther {\n\n    function withdrawWinnings() {\n        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0\n        require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n        _sendWinnings();\n     }\n\n     function _sendWinnings() {\n         msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n     }\n}\n\n\n\nThis simple contract is designed to act as an address-guessing bounty\ngame. To win the balance of the contract, a user must generate an\nEthereum address whose last 8 hex characters are 0. Once achieved, they\ncan call the withdrawWinnings function to obtain their bounty.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the visibility of the functions has not been specified.\nIn particular, the _sendWinnings function is public (the default), and thus any\naddress can call this function to steal the bounty.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nIt is good practice to always specify the visibility of all functions in\na contract, even if they are intentionally public. Recent versions of\nsolc show a warning for functions that\nhave no explicit visibility set, to encourage this practice.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (First Hack)\n\nIn the first Parity multisig hack, about $31M worth of Ether was stolen,\nmostly from three wallets. A good recap of exactly how this was done\nis given by Haseeb Qureshi.\n\n\nEssentially, the multisig wallet\nis constructed from a base Wallet contract, which calls a library\ncontract containing the core functionality (as described in\nReal-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (Second Hack)).\nThe library contract contains the code to initialize the wallet, as can\nbe seen from the following snippet:\n\n\n\ncontract WalletLibrary is WalletEvents {\n\n  ...\n\n  // METHODS\n\n  ...\n\n  // constructor is given number of sigs required to do protected\n  // \"onlymanyowners\" transactionsas well as the selection of addresses\n  // capable of confirming them\n  function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {\n    m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;\n    m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);\n    m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;\n    for (uint i = 0; i \n\n\n\nNote that neither of the functions specifies their\nvisibility, so both default to public. The initWallet\nfunction is called in the wallet’s constructor, and sets the owners for\nthe multisig wallet as can be seen in the initMultiowned function.\nBecause these functions were accidentally left public, an attacker was\nable to call these functions on deployed contracts, resetting the\nownership to the attacker’s address. Being the owner, the attacker then\ndrained the wallets of all their ether.\n\n\n\n\nEntropy Illusion\n\nAll transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are deterministic state\ntransition operations. This means that every transaction modifies the\nglobal state of the Ethereum ecosystem in a calculable\nway, with no uncertainty. This has the fundamental implication that\nthere is no source of entropy or randomness in Ethereum.\nAchieving decentralized entropy\n(randomness) is a well-known problem for which many solutions have been proposed, including RANDAO, or using a chain of hashes, as\ndescribed by Vitalik Buterin in the blog post\n“Validator Ordering and Randomness in PoS”.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nSome of the first contracts built on the Ethereum platform were based\naround gambling. Fundamentally, gambling requires uncertainty (something\nto bet on), which makes building a gambling system on the blockchain (a\ndeterministic system) rather difficult. It is clear that the uncertainty\nmust come from a source external to the blockchain. This is possible for\nbets between players (see for example the commit–reveal technique); however, it is significantly more difficult if you want to\nimplement a contract to act as “the house” (like in blackjack or\nroulette). A common pitfall is to use future block variables—that is,\nvariables containing information about the transaction block whose values are not yet known, such as\nhashes, timestamps, block numbers, or gas limits. The issue with these are\nthat they are controlled by the miner who mines the block, and as such\nare not truly random. Consider, for example, a roulette smart contract\nwith logic that returns a black number if the next block hash ends in an\neven number. A miner (or miner pool) could bet $1M on black. If they\nsolve the next block and find the hash ends in an odd number, they could\nhappily not publish their block and mine another, until they find a\nsolution with the block hash being an even number (assuming the block\nreward and fees are less than $1M). Using past or present variables can\nbe even more devastating, as Martin Swende demonstrates in his excellent blog post.\nFurthermore, using solely block variables means that the pseudorandom\nnumber will be the same for all transactions in a block, so an attacker\ncan multiply their wins by doing many transactions within a block\n(should there be a maximum bet).\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThe source of entropy (randomness) must be external to the blockchain.\nThis can be done among peers with systems such as\ncommit–reveal,\nor via changing the trust model to a group of participants (as in\nRandDAO). This can also be done via a\ncentralized entity that acts as a randomness oracle. Block variables\n(in general, there are some exceptions) should not be used to source\nentropy, as they can be manipulated by miners.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: PRNG Contracts\n\nIn February 2018 Arseny Reutov\nblogged about his analysis of 3,649 live smart contracts that were using some\nsort of pseudorandom number generator (PRNG); he found 43 contracts\nthat could be exploited.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Contract Referencing\n\nOne of the benefits of the Ethereum “world computer” is the ability to\nreuse code and interact with contracts already deployed on the network.\nAs a result, a large number of contracts reference external contracts,\nusually via external message calls.\nThese external message calls can mask malicious actors'\nintentions in some nonobvious ways, which we’ll now examine.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nIn Solidity, any address can be cast to a contract, regardless of whether\nthe code at the address represents the contract type being cast. This\ncan cause problems, especially when the author of the contract is trying\nto hide malicious code. Let’s illustrate this with an example.\n\n\nConsider a piece of code like Rot13Encryption.sol, which rudimentarily implements the\nROT13 cipher.\n\n\nExample 8. Rot13Encryption.sol\n\n\n\n// encryption contract\ncontract Rot13Encryption {\n\n   event Result(string convertedString);\n\n    // rot13-encrypt a string\n    function rot13Encrypt (string text) public {\n        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;\n        for (var i = 0; i  and 'z'\n                { char:= sub(0x60, sub(0x7A,char)) }\n                if iszero(eq(char, 0x20)) // ignore spaces\n                // add 13 to char\n                {mstore8(add(add(text,0x20), mul(i,1)), add(char,13))}\n            }\n        }\n        emit Result(text);\n    }\n\n    // rot13-decrypt a string\n    function rot13Decrypt (string text) public {\n        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;\n        for (var i = 0; i \n\n\n\n\n\nThis code simply takes a string (letters a–z, without validation) and\nencrypts it by shifting each character 13 places to the right (wrapping\naround z); i.e., a shifts to n and x shifts to k. The assembly\nin the preceding contract does not need to be understood to appreciate the issue\nbeing discussed, so readers unfamiliar with assembly can safely ignore it.\n\n\nNow consider the following contract, which uses this code for its encryption:\n\n\n\nimport \"Rot13Encryption.sol\";\n\n// encrypt your top-secret info\ncontract EncryptionContract {\n    // library for encryption\n    Rot13Encryption encryptionLibrary;\n\n    // constructor - initialize the library\n    constructor(Rot13Encryption _encryptionLibrary) {\n        encryptionLibrary = _encryptionLibrary;\n    }\n\n    function encryptPrivateData(string privateInfo) {\n        // potentially do some operations here\n        encryptionLibrary.rot13Encrypt(privateInfo);\n     }\n }\n\n\n\nThe issue with this contract is that the encryptionLibrary address is\nnot public or constant. Thus, the deployer of the contract could give an address in the constructor that points to this contract:\n\n\n\n// encryption contract\ncontract Rot26Encryption {\n\n   event Result(string convertedString);\n\n    // rot13-encrypt a string\n    function rot13Encrypt (string text) public {\n        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;\n        for (var i = 0; i  and 'z'\n                { char:= sub(0x60, sub(0x7A,char)) }\n                // ignore spaces\n                if iszero(eq(char, 0x20))\n                // add 26 to char!\n                {mstore8(add(add(text,0x20), mul(i,1)), add(char,26))}\n            }\n        }\n        emit Result(text);\n    }\n\n    // rot13-decrypt a string\n    function rot13Decrypt (string text) public {\n        uint256 length = bytes(text).length;\n        for (var i = 0; i \n\n\n\nThis contract implements the ROT26 cipher, which shifts each character by 26 places\n(i.e., does nothing). Again, there is no need to understand the assembly in this\ncontract. More simply, the attacker could have linked the following\ncontract to the same effect:\n\n\n\ncontract Print{\n    event Print(string text);\n\n    function rot13Encrypt(string text) public {\n        emit Print(text);\n    }\n }\n\n\n\nIf the address of either of these contracts were given in the\nconstructor, the encryptPrivateData function would simply produce an\nevent that prints the unencrypted private data.\n\n\nAlthough in this\nexample a library-like contract was set in the constructor, it is often\nthe case that a privileged user (such as an owner) can change library\ncontract addresses. If a linked contract doesn’t contain the function\nbeing called, the fallback function will execute. For example, with the\nline encryptionLibrary.rot13​Encrypt(), if the contract specified by\nencryptionLibrary was:\n\n\n\n contract Blank {\n     event Print(string text);\n     function () {\n         emit Print(\"Here\");\n         // put malicious code here and it will run\n     }\n }\n\n\n\nthen an event with the text Here would be emitted. Thus, if users can\nalter contract libraries, they can in principle get other users to unknowingly\nrun arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe contracts represented here are for demonstrative purposes only and\ndo not represent proper encryption. They should not be used for\nencryption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nAs demonstrated previously, safe contracts can (in some cases)\nbe deployed in such a way that they behave maliciously. An auditor could\npublicly verify a contract and have its owner deploy it in a malicious\nway, resulting in a publicly audited contract that has vulnerabilities\nor malicious intent.\n\n\nThere are a number of techniques that prevent these scenarios.\n\n\nOne technique is to use the new keyword to create contracts. In the\npreceding example, the constructor could be written as:\n\n\n\nconstructor() {\n    encryptionLibrary = new Rot13Encryption();\n}\n\n\n\nThis way an instance of the referenced contract is created at deployment\ntime, and the deployer cannot replace the Rot13Encryption contract\nwithout changing it.\n\n\nAnother solution is to hardcode external contract addresses.\n\n\nIn general, code that calls external contracts should always be\naudited carefully. As a developer, when defining external contracts, it can\nbe a good idea to make the contract addresses public (which is not the\ncase in the honey-pot example in the following section) to allow users to easily examine\ncode referenced by the contract. Conversely, if a contract has\na private variable contract address it can be a sign of someone behaving\nmaliciously (as shown in the real-world example). If a user can change\na contract address that is used to\ncall external functions, it can be important (in a decentralized system\ncontext) to implement a time-lock and/or voting mechanism to allow users to\nsee what code is being changed, or to give participants a chance to opt\nin/out with the new contract address.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Reentrancy Honey Pot\n\nA number of recent honey pots have been released on the mainnet. These\ncontracts try to outsmart Ethereum hackers who try to exploit the\ncontracts, but who in turn end up losing ether to the contract\nthey expect to exploit. One example employs this attack by\nreplacing an expected contract with a malicious one in the constructor.\nThe code can be found\nhere:\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n\ncontract Private_Bank\n{\n    mapping (address => uint) public balances;\n    uint public MinDeposit = 1 ether;\n    Log TransferLog;\n\n    function Private_Bank(address _log)\n    {\n        TransferLog = Log(_log);\n    }\n\n    function Deposit()\n    public\n    payable\n    {\n        if(msg.value >= MinDeposit)\n        {\n            balances[msg.sender]+=msg.value;\n            TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender,msg.value,\"Deposit\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    function CashOut(uint _am)\n    {\n        if(_am\n\n\n\nThis\npost\nby one reddit user explains how they lost 1 ether to this contract\nby trying to exploit the reentrancy bug they expected to be present in the\ncontract.\n\n\n\n\nShort Address/Parameter Attack\n\nThis attack is not performed on Solidity contracts\nthemselves, but on third-party applications that may interact with them. This\nsection is added for completeness and to give the reader an awareness of how parameters can be\nmanipulated in contracts.\n\n\nFor further reading, see\n“The ERC20\nShort Address Attack Explained”,\n“ICO\nSmart Contract Vulnerability: Short Address Attack”, or this\nReddit\npost.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nWhen passing parameters to a smart contract, the parameters are encoded\naccording to the\nABI\nspecification. It is possible to send encoded parameters that are\nshorter than the expected parameter length (for example, sending an\naddress that is only 38 hex chars (19 bytes) instead of the standard 40\nhex chars (20 bytes)). In such a scenario, the EVM will add zeros to the\nend of the encoded parameters to make up the expected length.\n\n\nThis becomes an issue when third-party applications do not validate\ninputs. The clearest example is an exchange that doesn’t verify the\naddress of an\nERC20 token\nwhen a user requests a withdrawal. This example is covered in more\ndetail in Peter Vessenes’s post,\n“The ERC20\nShort Address Attack Explained”.\n\n\nConsider the standard\nERC20\ntransfer function interface, noting the order of the parameters:\n\n\n\nfunction transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);\n\n\n\nNow consider an exchange holding a large amount of a token (let’s say\nREP) and a user who wishes to withdraw their share of 100 tokens. The user\nwould submit their address, 0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead,\nand the number of tokens, 100. The exchange would encode these\nparameters in the order specified by the transfer function; that is,\naddress then tokens. The encoded result would be:\n\n\n\na9059cbb000000000000000000000000deaddeaddea \\\nddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead0000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d63100000\n\n\n\nThe first 4\nbytes (a9059cbb) are the transfer\nfunction\nsignature/selector, the next 32 bytes are the address, and\nthe final 32 bytes represent the uint256 number of tokens.\nNotice that the hex 56bc75e2d63100000 at the end corresponds to 100\ntokens (with 18 decimal places, as specified by the REP token\ncontract).\n\n\nLet us now look at what would happen if one were to send an address that\nwas missing 1 byte (2 hex digits). Specifically, let’s say an attacker\nsends 0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeadde as an address (missing\nthe last two digits) and the same 100 tokens to withdraw. If the\nexchange does not validate this input, it will get encoded as:\n\n\n\na9059cbb000000000000000000000000deaddeaddea \\\nddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeadde00000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d6310000000\n\n\n\nThe difference\nis subtle. Note that 00 has been added to the end of the encoding, to\nmake up for the short address that was sent. When this gets sent to the\nsmart contract, the address parameters will be read as\n0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeadde00 and the value will be read\nas 56bc75e2d6310000000 (notice the two extra 0s). This value is\nnow 25600 tokens (the value has been multiplied by 256). In this\nexample, if the exchange held this many tokens, the user would withdraw\n25600 tokens (while the exchange thinks the user is only withdrawing\n100) to the modified address. Obviously the attacker won’t possess the\nmodified address in this example, but if the attacker were to generate\nany address that ended in 0s (which can be easily brute-forced) and\nused this generated address, they could steal tokens from the\nunsuspecting exchange.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nAll input parameters in external applications should be validated before\nsending them to the blockchain. It should\nalso be noted that parameter ordering plays an important role here. As padding\nonly occurs at the end, careful ordering of parameters in the smart contract\ncan mitigate some forms of this attack.\n\n\n\n\nUnchecked CALL Return Values\n\nThere are a number of ways of performing external calls in Solidity. Sending\nether to external accounts is commonly performed via the transfer method.\nHowever, the send function can also be used, and for more versatile\nexternal calls the CALL opcode can be directly employed in Solidity.\nThe call and send functions return a Boolean indicating whether the\ncall succeeded or failed. Thus, these functions have a simple caveat, in\nthat the transaction that executes these functions will not revert if\nthe external call (intialized by call or send) fails; rather, the\nfunctions will simply return false. A common error is\nthat the developer expects a revert to occur if the external call fails, and does not check the return value.\n\n\nFor further reading, see #4 on the DASP Top 10 of 2018 and\n“Scanning\nLive Ethereum Contracts for the ‘Unchecked-Send’ Bug”.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n\n\ncontract Lotto {\n\n    bool public payedOut = false;\n    address public winner;\n    uint public winAmount;\n\n    // ... extra functionality here\n\n    function sendToWinner() public {\n        require(!payedOut);\n        winner.send(winAmount);\n        payedOut = true;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawLeftOver() public {\n        require(payedOut);\n        msg.sender.send(this.balance);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis represents a Lotto-like contract, where a winner\nreceives winAmount of ether, which typically leaves a little left over\nfor anyone to withdraw.\n\n\nThe vulnerability exists on line 11, where a send is used without checking\nthe response. In this trivial example, a winner whose transaction\nfails (either by running out of gas or by being a contract that intentionally\nthrows in the fallback function) allows payedOut to be set to true regardless\nof whether ether was sent or not. In this case, anyone can withdraw\nthe winner’s winnings via the withdrawLeftOver function.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nWhenever possible, use the transfer function rather than send, as\ntransfer will revert if the external transaction reverts. If\nsend is required, always check the return value.\n\n\nA more robust\nrecommendation\nis to adopt a withdrawal pattern. In this solution, each user must\ncall an isolated withdraw function\nthat handles the sending of ether out of the contract and\ndeals with the consequences of failed send transactions.\nThe idea is to logically isolate the external send functionality from\nthe rest of the codebase, and place the burden of a potentially failed\ntransaction on the end user calling the withdraw function.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Etherpot and King of the Ether\n\nEtherpot was a smart contract lottery, not\ntoo dissimilar to the example contract mentioned earlier.\nThe downfall of this contract was primarily due to incorrect use of\nblock hashes (only the last 256 block hashes are usable; see Aakil\nFernandes’s\npost\nabout how Etherpot failed to take account of this correctly). However, this\ncontract also suffered from an unchecked call value. Consider the\nfunction cash in lotto.sol: Code snippet.\n\n\nExample 9. lotto.sol: Code snippet\n\n\n\n...\n  function cash(uint roundIndex, uint subpotIndex){\n\n        var subpotsCount = getSubpotsCount(roundIndex);\n\n        if(subpotIndex>=subpotsCount)\n            return;\n\n        var decisionBlockNumber = getDecisionBlockNumber(roundIndex,subpotIndex);\n\n        if(decisionBlockNumber>block.number)\n            return;\n\n        if(rounds[roundIndex].isCashed[subpotIndex])\n            return;\n        //Subpots can only be cashed once. This is to prevent double payouts\n\n        var winner = calculateWinner(roundIndex,subpotIndex);\n        var subpot = getSubpot(roundIndex);\n\n        winner.send(subpot);\n\n        rounds[roundIndex].isCashed[subpotIndex] = true;\n        //Mark the round as cashed\n}\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that on line 21 the send function’s return value is not\nchecked, and the following line then sets a Boolean indicating that the\nwinner has been sent their funds. This bug can allow a state where the\nwinner does not receive their ether, but the state of the contract can\nindicate that the winner has already been paid.\n\n\nA more serious version of this bug occurred in the\nKing of\nthe Ether. An excellent\npost-mortem of this\ncontract has been written that details how an unchecked failed send\ncould be used to attack the contract.\n\n\n\n\nRace Conditions/Front Running\n\nThe combination of external calls to other contracts and the multiuser\nnature of the underlying blockchain gives rise to a variety of potential\nSolidity pitfalls whereby users race code execution to obtain\nunexpected states. Reentrancy (discussed earlier in this chapter) is one example of such\na race condition. In this section we will discuss\nother kinds of race conditions that can occur on the Ethereum\nblockchain. There are a variety of good posts on this subject, including\n“Race Conditions” on the Ethereum\nWiki, #7 on the DASP Top10 of 2018, and the\nEthereum Smart Contract Best Practices.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nAs with most blockchains, Ethereum nodes pool transactions and form them\ninto blocks. The transactions are only considered valid once a miner has\nsolved a consensus mechanism (currently\nEthash PoW for Ethereum).\nThe miner who solves the block also chooses which transactions from the\npool will be included in the block, typically ordered by the\ngasPrice of each transaction. Here is a potential attack vector. An\nattacker can watch the transaction pool for transactions that may\ncontain solutions to problems, and modify or revoke the solver’s\npermissions or change state in a contract detrimentally to the\nsolver. The attacker can then get the data from this transaction and\ncreate a transaction of their own with a higher gasPrice so their\ntransaction is included in a block before the original.\n\n\nLet’s see how this could work with a simple example. Consider the\ncontract shown in FindThisHash.sol.\n\n\nExample 10. FindThisHash.sol\n\n\n\ncontract FindThisHash {\n    bytes32 constant public hash =\n      0xb5b5b97fafd9855eec9b41f74dfb6c38f5951141f9a3ecd7f44d5479b630ee0a;\n\n    constructor() public payable {} // load with ether\n\n    function solve(string solution) public {\n        // If you can find the pre-image of the hash, receive 1000 ether\n        require(hash == sha3(solution));\n        msg.sender.transfer(1000 ether);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSay this contract contains 1,000 ether. The user who can find the\npreimage of the following SHA-3 hash:\n\n\n\n0xb5b5b97fafd9855eec9b41f74dfb6c38f5951141f9a3ecd7f44d5479b630ee0a\n\n\n\ncan submit the solution and retrieve the 1,000 ether. Let’s say one user\nfigures out the solution is Ethereum!. They call solve with\nEthereum! as the parameter. Unfortunately, an attacker has been clever\nenough to watch the transaction pool for anyone submitting a solution.\nThey see this solution, check its validity, and then submit an\nequivalent transaction with a much higher gasPrice than the original\ntransaction. The miner who solves the block will likely give the\nattacker preference due to the higher gasPrice, and mine their\ntransaction before the original solver’s. The attacker will take the 1,000\nether, and the user who solved the problem will get nothing. Keep in mind that in this type of \"front-running\" vulnerability, miners are uniquely incentivized to run the attacks themselves (or can be bribed to run these attacks with extravagant fees). The possibility of the attacker being a miner themselves should not be underestimated.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThere are two classes of actor who can perform these kinds of\nfront-running attacks: users (who modify the gasPrice of their\ntransactions) and miners themselves (who can reorder the transactions\nin a block how they see fit). A contract that is vulnerable to the first\nclass (users) is significantly worse off than one vulnerable to the\nsecond (miners), as miners can only perform the attack when they solve a\nblock, which is unlikely for any individual miner targeting a specific\nblock. Here we’ll list a few mitigation measures relative to both\nclasses of attackers.\n\n\nOne method is to place an upper bound on the gasPrice.\nThis prevents users from\nincreasing the gasPrice and getting preferential transaction ordering\nbeyond the upper bound. This measure only guards against the\nfirst class of attackers (arbitrary users). Miners in this scenario can\nstill attack the contract, as they can order the transactions in their\nblock however they like, regardless of gas price.\n\n\nA more robust method is to use a\ncommit–reveal\nscheme. Such a scheme dictates that users send\ntransactions with hidden information (typically a hash). After the\ntransaction has been included in a block, the user sends a transaction\nrevealing the data that was sent (the reveal phase). This method\nprevents both miners and users from front-running transactions, as they\ncannot determine the contents of the transaction. This method, however,\ncannot conceal the transaction value (which in some cases is the\nvaluable information that needs to be hidden). The\nENS smart contract allowed users to send\ntransactions whose committed data included the amount of ether they\nwere willing to spend. Users could then send transactions of arbitrary\nvalue. During the reveal phase, users were refunded the difference\nbetween the amount sent in the transaction and the amount they were\nwilling to spend.\n\n\nA further suggestion by Lorenz Breidenbach, Phil Daian, Ari Juels, and Florian Tramèr is to use\n“submarine\nsends”. An efficient implementation of this idea requires the CREATE2\nopcode, which currently hasn’t been adopted but seems likely to be in\nupcoming hard forks.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples: ERC20 and Bancor\n\nThe ERC20\nstandard is quite well-known for building tokens on Ethereum. This\nstandard has a potential front-running vulnerability that comes about\ndue to the approve function. Mikhail Vladimirov and Dmitry Khovratovich have written a good explanation of this\nvulnerability (and ways to mitigate the attack).\n\n\nThe standard specifies the approve function as:\n\n\n\nfunction approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success)\n\n\n\nThis function allows a user to permit other users to transfer tokens on\ntheir behalf. The front-running vulnerability occurs in the scenario where\na user Alice approves her friend Bob to spend 100 tokens. Alice\nlater decides that she wants to revoke Bob’s approval to spend, say,\n100 tokens, so she creates a transaction that sets Bob’s allocation\nto 50 tokens. Bob, who has been carefully watching the chain, sees\nthis transaction and builds a transaction of his own spending the\n100 tokens. He puts a higher gasPrice on his transaction than\nAlice’s, so gets his transaction prioritized over hers. Some\nimplementations of approve would allow Bob to transfer his\n100 tokens and then, when Alice’s transaction is committed, reset\nBob’s approval to 50 tokens, in effect giving Bob access to\n150 tokens.\n\n\nAnother prominent real-world example is\nBancor. Ivan Bogatyy and his team\ndocumented a profitable attack on the initial Bancor implementation. His\nblog\npost and DevCon3 talk\ndiscuss in detail how this was done. Essentially, prices of tokens are\ndetermined based on transaction value; users can watch the transaction\npool for Bancor transactions and front-run them to profit from the price\ndifferences. This attack has been addressed by the Bancor team.\n\n\n\n\nDenial of Service (DoS)\n\nThis category is very broad, but fundamentally consists of attacks where\nusers can render a contract inoperable for a period of time, or\nin some cases permanently. This can trap ether in these contracts\nforever, as was the case in Real-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (Second Hack).\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nThere are various ways a contract can become inoperable. Here we\nhighlight just a few less-obvious Solidity\ncoding patterns that can lead to DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n\n\nLooping through externally manipulated mappings or arrays\n\nThis pattern typically appears when an owner wishes to distribute tokens\nto investors with a distribute-like function,\nas in this example contract:\n\n\ncontract DistributeTokens {\n    address public owner; // gets set somewhere\n    address[] investors; // array of investors\n    uint[] investorTokens; // the amount of tokens each investor gets\n\n    // ... extra functionality, including transfertoken()\n\n    function invest() public payable {\n        investors.push(msg.sender);\n        investorTokens.push(msg.value * 5); // 5 times the wei sent\n        }\n\n    function distribute() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner); // only owner\n        for(uint i = 0; i \n\n\n\nNotice that the loop in this contract runs over an array that can be\nartificially inflated. An attacker can create many user accounts, making\nthe investor array large. In principle this can be done such that the\ngas required to execute the for loop exceeds the block gas limit,\nessentially making the distribute function inoperable.\n\n\nOwner operations\n\nAnother common pattern is where owners have\nspecific privileges in contracts and must perform some task in order for\nthe contract to proceed to the next state. One example would be an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)\ncontract that requires the owner to finalize the contract, which then\nallows tokens to be transferable. For example:\n\n\nbool public isFinalized = false;\naddress public owner; // gets set somewhere\n\nfunction finalize() public {\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\n    isFinalized == true;\n}\n\n// ... extra ICO functionality\n\n// overloaded transfer function\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {\n    require(isFinalized);\n    super.transfer(_to,_value)\n}\n\n...\n\n\n\nIn such cases, if the privileged user loses their private keys or becomes\ninactive, the entire token contract becomes inoperable. In this case, if\nthe owner cannot call finalize no tokens can be transferred;\nthe entire operation of the token ecosystem hinges on a single\naddress.\n\n\nProgressing state based on external calls\n\nContracts are sometimes written\nsuch that progressing to a new state requires sending ether to an\naddress, or waiting for some input from an external source.  These patterns can\nlead to DoS attacks when the external call fails or is prevented for external\nreasons. In the example of sending ether, a user can create a contract that\ndoes not accept ether. If a contract requires ether to be withdrawn in order to progress to a new state (consider a\ntime-locking contract that requires all ether to be withdrawn before being\nusable again), the contract will never\nachieve the new state, as ether can never be sent to the user’s contract that\ndoes not accept ether.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nIn the first example, contracts should not loop through data structures\nthat can be artificially manipulated by external users. A withdrawal\npattern is recommended, whereby each of the investors call a withdraw\nfunction to claim tokens independently.\n\n\nIn the second example, a privileged user was required to change the state\nof the contract. In such examples a failsafe can be\nused in the event that the owner becomes incapacitated. One solution\nis to make the owner a multisig contract. Another solution\nis to use a time-lock: in the example given the require on line 13 could include a\ntime-based mechanism, such as\nrequire(msg.sender == owner || now > unlockTime), that allows any user\nto finalize after a period of time specified by unlockTime. This kind\nof mitigation technique can be used in the third example also. If\nexternal calls are required to progress to a new state, account for\ntheir possible failure and potentially add a time-based state\nprogression in the event that the desired call never comes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOf course, there are centralized alternatives to these suggestions:\none can add a maintenanceUser who can come along and fix\nproblems with DoS-based attack vectors if need be. Typically these kinds\nof contracts have trust issues, because of the power of such an entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples: GovernMental\n\nGovernMental was an old\nPonzi scheme that accumulated quite a large amount of ether (1,100 ether, at one point). Unfortunately, it was\nsusceptible to the DoS vulnerabilities mentioned in this section. A Reddit post by etherik describes how the contract required the deletion of a large\nmapping in order to withdraw the ether. The deletion of this mapping had\na gas cost that exceeded the block gas limit at the time, and thus it was\nnot possible to withdraw the 1,100 ether. The contract address is\n0xF45717552f12Ef7cb65e95476F217Ea008167Ae3,\nand you can see from transaction 0x0d80d67202bd9cb6773df8dd2020e719&thinsp;0a1b0793e8ec4fc105257e8128f0506b that the 1,100 ether were finally obtained with a transaction that used\n2.5M gas (when the block gas limit had risen enough to allow such a transaction).\n\n\n\n\nBlock Timestamp Manipulation\n\nBlock timestamps have historically been used for a variety of\napplications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the\nEntropy Illusion for further details), locking\nfunds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional\nstatements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust\ntimestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block\ntimestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.\n\n\nUseful references for this include\nthe\nSolidity docs and Joris Bontje’s Ethereum Stack\nExchange question on the topic.\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nblock.timestamp and its alias now can be manipulated by miners if\nthey have some incentive to do so. Let’s construct a simple game, shown in roulette.sol, that\nwould be vulnerable to miner exploitation.\n\n\nExample 11. roulette.sol\n\n\n\ncontract Roulette {\n    uint public pastBlockTime; // forces one bet per block\n\n    constructor() public payable {} // initially fund contract\n\n    // fallback function used to make a bet\n    function () public payable {\n        require(msg.value == 10 ether); // must send 10 ether to play\n        require(now != pastBlockTime); // only 1 transaction per block\n        pastBlockTime = now;\n        if(now % 15 == 0) { // winner\n            msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contract behaves like a simple lottery. One transaction per block\ncan bet 10 ether for a chance to win the balance of the contract. The\nassumption here is that `block.timestamp’s last two digits are uniformly distributed. If that were the case, there would be a 1 in 15\nchance of winning this lottery.\n\n\nHowever, as we know, miners can adjust the timestamp should they need\nto. In this particular case, if enough ether pools in the contract, a\nminer who solves a block is incentivized to choose a timestamp such that\nblock.timestamp or now modulo 15 is 0. In doing so they may win\nthe ether locked in this contract along with the block reward. As there\nis only one person allowed to bet per block, this is also vulnerable to\nfront-running attacks (see Race Conditions/Front Running for further details).\n\n\nIn practice, block timestamps are monotonically increasing and so miners\ncannot choose arbitrary block timestamps (they must be later than their\npredecessors). They are also limited to setting block times not too far\nin the future, as these blocks will likely be rejected by the network\n(nodes will not validate blocks whose timestamps are in the future).\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nBlock timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random\nnumbers—i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly\nor through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important\nstate.\n\n\nTime-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts\n(time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry\ndates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with\na 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks.\nThus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can\nbe more secure, as miners are unable easily to manipulate the block number. The\nBAT\nICO contract employed this strategy.\n\n\nThis can be unnecessary if contracts aren’t particularly concerned with\nminer manipulations of the block timestamp, but it is something to be\naware of when developing contracts.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: GovernMental\n\nGovernMental, the old Ponzi scheme mentioned above, was also\nvulnerable to a timestamp-based attack. The contract paid out to the\nplayer who was the last player to join (for at least one minute) in a\nround. Thus, a miner who was a player could adjust the timestamp (to a\nfuture time, to make it look like a minute had elapsed) to make it\nappear that they were the last player to join for over a minute (even\nthough this was not true in reality). More detail on this can be found in\nthe\n“History\nof Ethereum Security Vulnerabilities, Hacks and Their Fixes” post by Tanya Bahrynovska.\n\n\n\n\nConstructors with Care\n\nConstructors are special functions that often perform critical,\nprivileged tasks when initializing contracts. Before Solidity v0.4.22,\nconstructors were defined as functions that had the same name as the\ncontract that contained them. In such cases, when the contract name is changed in\ndevelopment, if the constructor name isn’t changed too it becomes a normal,\ncallable function. As you can imagine, this can lead (and has) to some\ninteresting contract hacks.\n\n\nFor further insight, the reader may be interested in attempting the\nEthernaut challenges (in\nparticular the Fallout level).\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nIf the contract name is modified, or there is a typo in the\nconstructor’s name such that it does not match the name of the\ncontract, the constructor will behave like a normal function. This can\nlead to dire consequences, especially if the constructor performs\nprivileged operations. Consider the following contract:\n\n\n\ncontract OwnerWallet {\n    address public owner;\n\n    // constructor\n    function ownerWallet(address _owner) public {\n        owner = _owner;\n    }\n\n    // Fallback. Collect ether.\n    function () payable {}\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis contract collects ether and allows only the owner to withdraw it,\nby calling the withdraw function. The issue arises because the constructor is not named exactly the same as the contract:\nthe first letter is different! Thus, any\nuser can call the ownerWallet function, set themselves as the owner,\nand then take all the ether in the contract by calling withdraw.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThis issue has been addressed in version 0.4.22 of the Solidity compiler. This version introduced a constructor keyword that\nspecifies the constructor, rather than requiring the name of the\nfunction to match the contract name. Using this keyword to specify\nconstructors is recommended to prevent naming issues.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Rubixi\n\nRubixi was another pyramid scheme that exhibited this kind of\nvulnerability. It was originally called DynamicPyramid, but the\ncontract name was changed before deployment to Rubixi. The\nconstructor’s name wasn’t changed, allowing any user to become the\ncreator. Some interesting discussion related to this bug can be found\non Bitcointalk. Ultimately, it allowed users to fight for creator status to\nclaim the fees from the pyramid scheme. More detail on this particular\nbug can be found in “History of Ethereum Security Vulnerabilities, Hacks and Their Fixes”.\n\n\n\n\nUninitialized Storage Pointers\n\nThe EVM stores data either as storage or as memory. Understanding\nexactly how this is done and the default types for local variables of\nfunctions is highly recommended when developing contracts. This is\nbecause it is possible to produce vulnerable contracts by\ninappropriately intializing variables.\n\n\nTo read more about storage and memory in the EVM, see the Solidity documentation on data location, layout of state variables in storage, and layout in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis section is based on an excellent\npost\nby Stefan Beyer. Further reading on this topic, inspired by Stefan, can be found in this\nReddit\nthread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nLocal variables within functions default to storage or memory\ndepending on their type. Uninitialized local storage variables may\ncontain the value of other storage variables in the contract; this fact\ncan cause unintentional vulnerabilities, or be exploited deliberately.\n\n\nLet’s consider the relatively simple name registrar contract in NameRegistrar.sol.\n\n\nExample 12. NameRegistrar.sol\n\n\n\n// A locked name registrar\ncontract NameRegistrar {\n\n    bool public unlocked = false;  // registrar locked, no name updates\n\n    struct NameRecord { // map hashes to addresses\n        bytes32 name;\n        address mappedAddress;\n    }\n\n    // records who registered names\n    mapping(address => NameRecord) public registeredNameRecord;\n    // resolves hashes to addresses\n    mapping(bytes32 => address) public resolve;\n\n    function register(bytes32 _name, address _mappedAddress) public {\n        // set up the new NameRecord\n        NameRecord newRecord;\n        newRecord.name = _name;\n        newRecord.mappedAddress = _mappedAddress;\n\n        resolve[_name] = _mappedAddress;\n        registeredNameRecord[msg.sender] = newRecord;\n\n        require(unlocked); // only allow registrations if contract is unlocked\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple name registrar has only one function. When the contract is\nunlocked, it allows anyone to register a name (as a bytes32 hash)\nand map that name to an address. The registrar is\ninitially locked, and the require on line 25 prevents register\nfrom adding name records. It seems that the contract is unusable, as\nthere is no way to unlock the registry! There is, however, a vulnerability\nthat allows name registration regardless of the unlocked variable.\n\n\nTo discuss this vulnerability, first we need to understand how storage\nworks in Solidity. As a high-level overview (without any proper\ntechnical detail—we suggest reading the Solidity docs for a proper\nreview), state variables are stored sequentially in slots as they\nappear in the contract (they can be grouped together but aren’t in this\nexample, so we won’t worry about that). Thus, unlocked exists in\nslot[0], registeredNameRecord in slot[1], and resolve in\nslot[2], etc. Each of these slots is 32 bytes in size (there are added\ncomplexities with mappings, which we’ll ignore for now). The Boolean\nunlocked will look like 0x000…​0 (64 0s, excluding the 0x) for\nfalse or 0x000…​1 (63 0s) for true. As you can see, there is a\nsignificant waste of storage in this particular example.\n\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle is that Solidity by default puts\ncomplex data types, such as structs, in storage when initializing\nthem as local variables. Therefore, newRecord on line 18 defaults to storage. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that newRecord is\nnot initialized. Because it defaults to storage, it is mapped to\nstorage slot[0], which currently contains a pointer to unlocked.\nNotice that on lines 19 and 20 we\nthen set newRecord.name to _name and newRecord.mappedAddress to _mappedAddress; this updates the storage locations of slot[0]\nand slot[1], which modifies both unlocked and the storage slot\nassociated with registeredNameRecord.\n\n\nThis means that unlocked can be directly modified, simply by the\nbytes32 _name parameter of the register function. Therefore, if\nthe last byte of _name is nonzero, it will modify the last byte of\nstorage slot[0] and directly change unlocked to true. Such _name\nvalues will cause the require call on line 25 to succeed, as we have set\nunlocked to true. Try this in Remix. Note the function will pass\nif you use a _name of the form:\n\n\n\n0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\n\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nThe Solidity compiler shows a warning for unintialized storage variables;\ndevelopers should pay careful attention to these warnings when\nbuilding smart contracts. The current version of Mist (0.10) doesn’t\nallow these contracts to be compiled. It is often good practice to\nexplicitly use the memory or storage specifiers when dealing with complex types,\nto ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples: OpenAddressLottery and CryptoRoulette Honey Pots\n\nA honey pot named OpenAddressLottery was deployed that used this uninitialized storage variable quirk\nto collect ether from some would-be hackers. The contract is rather\ninvolved, so we will leave the analysis to the Reddit\nthread where the attack is quite clearly explained.\n\n\nAnother honey pot, CryptoRoulette, also utilized this trick to try and collect some ether. If you\ncan’t figure out how the attack works, see\n“An\nAnalysis of a Couple Ethereum Honeypot Contracts” for an overview of\nthis contract and others.\n\n\n\n\nFloating Point and Precision\n\nAs of this writing (v0.4.24), Solidity does not support fixed-point and floating-point\nnumbers. This means that floating-point\nrepresentations must be constructed with integer types in Solidity. This\ncan lead to errors and vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor further reading, see the\nEthereum\nContract Security Techniques and Tips wiki.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nAs there is no fixed-point type in Solidity, developers are required to\nimplement their own using the standard integer data types. There are a\nnumber of pitfalls developers can run into during this process. We will\ntry to highlight some of these in this section.\n\n\nLet’s begin with a code example (we’ll ignore over/underflow issues, discussed earlier in this chapter, for simplicity):\n\n\n\ncontract FunWithNumbers {\n    uint constant public tokensPerEth = 10;\n    uint constant public weiPerEth = 1e18;\n    mapping(address => uint) public balances;\n\n    function buyTokens() public payable {\n        // convert wei to eth, then multiply by token rate\n        uint tokens = msg.value/weiPerEth*tokensPerEth;\n        balances[msg.sender] += tokens;\n    }\n\n    function sellTokens(uint tokens) public {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= tokens);\n        uint eth = tokens/tokensPerEth;\n        balances[msg.sender] -= tokens;\n        msg.sender.transfer(eth*weiPerEth);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis simple token buying/selling contract has some obvious problems. Although the mathematical calculations\nfor buying and selling tokens are correct, the lack of floating-point\nnumbers will give erroneous results. For example, when buying tokens on\nline 8, if the value is less than 1 ether the initial division will\nresult in 0, leaving the result of the final multiplication as 0 (e.g., 200 wei\ndivided by 1e18 weiPerEth equals 0). Similarly, when selling\ntokens, any number of tokens less than 10 will also result in 0 ether. In\nfact, rounding here is always down, so selling 29 tokens will result\nin 2 ether.\n\n\nThe issue with this contract is that the precision is only to the\nnearest ether (i.e., 1e18 wei). This can get tricky when\ndealing with decimals in\nERC20\ntokens when you need higher precision.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\nKeeping the right precision in your smart contracts is very important,\nespecially when dealing with ratios and rates that reflect economic\ndecisions.\n\n\nYou should ensure that any ratios or rates you are using allow for large\nnumerators in fractions. For example, we used the rate tokensPerEth in\nour example. It would have been better to use weiPerTokens, which would\nbe a large number. To calculate the corresponding number of tokens we could do\nmsg.sender/weiPerTokens. This would give a more precise result.\n\n\nAnother tactic to keep in mind is to be mindful of order of operations.\nIn our example, the calculation to purchase tokens was\nmsg.value/weiPerEth*tokenPerEth. Notice that the division occurs\nbefore the multiplication. (Solidity, unlike some languages, guarantees to perform operations in the order in which they are written.) This example would have achieved a greater\nprecision if the calculation performed the multiplication first and then\nthe division; i.e., msg.value*tokenPerEth/weiPerEth.\n\n\nFinally, when defining arbitrary precision for numbers it can be a good\nidea to convert values to higher precision, perform all\nmathematical operations, then finally convert back down to\nthe precision required for output. Typically uint256s are used (as they are\noptimal for gas usage); these give approximately 60 orders of magnitude\nin their range, some of which can be dedicated to the precision of\nmathematical operations. It may be the case that it is better to keep\nall variables in high precision in Solidity and convert back to lower\nprecisions in external apps (this is essentially how the decimals\nvariable works in ERC20 token\ncontracts). To see an example of how this can be done, we recommend looking at DS-Math. It uses some\nfunky naming (“wads” and “rays”), but the concept is useful.\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Ethstick\n\nThe Ethstick contract does not use extended precision; however, it deals with wei. So,\nthis contract will have issues of rounding, but only at the wei level\nof precision. It has some more serious flaws, but these relate\nback to the difficulty in getting entropy on the blockchain (see\nEntropy Illusion). For a further discussion of\nthe Ethstick contract, we’ll refer you to another post by Peter Vessenes,\n“Ethereum\nContracts Are Going to Be Candy for Hackers”.\n\n\n\n\nTx.Origin Authentication\n\nSolidity has a global variable, tx.origin, which traverses the entire\ncall stack and contains the address of the account that originally sent\nthe call (or transaction). Using this variable for authentication in a smart contract leaves the contract vulnerable to a phishing-like\nattack.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor further reading, see dbryson’s Ethereum Stack\nExchange question,\n“Tx.Origin and Ethereum Oh My!” by Peter Vessenes, and\n“Solidity: Tx Origin Attacks” by Chris Coverdale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerability\n\nContracts that authorize users using the tx.origin variable are\ntypically vulnerable to phishing attacks that can trick users into\nperforming authenticated actions on the vulnerable contract.\n\n\nConsider the simple contract in Phishable.sol.\n\n\nExample 13. Phishable.sol\n\n\n\ncontract Phishable {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor (address _owner) {\n        owner = _owner;\n    }\n\n    function () public payable {} // collect ether\n\n    function withdrawAll(address _recipient) public {\n        require(tx.origin == owner);\n        _recipient.transfer(this.balance);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that on line 11 the contract authorizes the withdrawAll\nfunction using tx.origin. This contract allows for an attacker to\ncreate an attacking contract of the form:\n\n\n\nimport \"Phishable.sol\";\n\ncontract AttackContract {\n\n    Phishable phishableContract;\n    address attacker; // The attacker's address to receive funds\n\n    constructor (Phishable _phishableContract, address _attackerAddress) {\n        phishableContract = _phishableContract;\n        attacker = _attackerAddress;\n    }\n\n    function () payable {\n        phishableContract.withdrawAll(attacker);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThe attacker might disguise this contract as their own private address and socially engineer the victim (the owner of the Phishable contract) to send some form of transaction to the address—perhaps sending this contract some amount of ether. The victim, unless careful, may not notice that\nthere is code at the attacker’s address, or the attacker might pass it off\nas being a multisignature wallet or some advanced storage wallet (remember\nthat the source code of public contracts is not available by default).\n\n\nIn any case, if the victim sends a transaction with enough gas to the\nAttackContract address, it will invoke the fallback function, which in\nturn calls the withdrawAll function of the Phishable contract\nwith the parameter attacker. This will result in the withdrawal of all\nfunds from the Phishable contract to the attacker address. This is\nbecause the address that first initialized the call was the victim\n(i.e., the owner of the Phishable contract). Therefore, tx.origin\nwill be equal to owner and the require on line 11 of the\nPhishable contract will pass.\n\n\n\nPreventative Techniques\n\ntx.origin should not be used for authorization in smart contracts.\nThis isn’t to say that the tx.origin variable should never be used. It\ndoes have some legitimate use cases in smart contracts. For example, if\none wanted to deny external contracts from calling the current contract,\none could implement a require of the form\nrequire(tx.origin == msg.sender). This prevents intermediate contracts\nbeing used to call the current contract, limiting the contract to\nregular codeless addresses.\n\n\n\n\nContract Libraries\n\nThere is a lot of existing code available for reuse, both deployed on-chain as callable libraries and off-chain as code template libraries. On-platform libraries, having been deployed, exist as bytecode smart contracts, so great care should be taken before using them in production. However, using well-established existing on-platform libraries comes with many advantages, such as being able to benefit from the latest upgrades, and saves you money and benefits the Ethereum ecosystem by reducing the total number of live contracts in Ethereum.\n\n\nIn Ethereum, the most widely used resource is the OpenZeppelin suite, an ample library of contracts ranging from implementations of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, to many flavors of crowdsale models, to simple behaviors commonly found in contracts, such as Ownable, Pausable, or LimitBalance. The contracts in this repository have been extensively tested and in some cases even function as de facto standard implementations. They are free to use, and are built and maintained by Zeppelin together with an ever-growing list of external contributors.\n\n\nAlso from Zeppelin is ZeppelinOS, an open source platform of services and tools to develop and manage smart contract applications securely. ZeppelinOS provides a layer on top of the EVM that makes it easy for developers to launch upgradeable DApps linked to an on-chain library of well-tested contracts that are themselves upgradeable. Different versions of these libraries can coexist on the Ethereum platform, and a vouching system allows users to propose or push improvements in different directions. A set of off-chain tools to debug, test, deploy, and monitor decentralized applications is also provided by the platform.\n\n\nThe project ethpm aims to organize the various resources that are developing in the ecosystem by providing a package management system. As such, their registry provides more examples for you to browse:\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://www.ethpm.com/\n\n\nRepository link: https://www.ethpm.com/registry\n\n\nGitHub link: https://github.com/ethpm\n\n\nDocumentation: https://www.ethpm.com/docs/integration-guide\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is a lot for any developer working in the smart contract domain to know and understand. By following best practices in your smart contract design and code writing, you will avoid many severe pitfalls and traps.\n\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental software security principle is to maximize reuse of trusted code. In cryptography, this is so important it has been condensed into an adage: \"Don’t roll your own crypto.\" In the case of smart contracts, this amounts to gaining as much as possible from freely available libraries that have been thoroughly vetted by the community.\n\n\n\n"},"10tokens.html":{"url":"10tokens.html","title":"Chapter 10: Tokens","keywords":"","body":"\nTokens\n\n\nThe word \"token\" derives from the Old English \"tācen,\" meaning a sign or symbol. It is commonly used to refer to privately issued special-purpose coin-like items of insignificant intrinsic value, such as transportation tokens, laundry tokens, and arcade game tokens.\n\n\nNowadays, \"tokens\" administered on blockchains are redefining the word to mean blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that represent assets, currency, or access rights.\n\n\nThe association between the word \"token\" and insignificant value has a lot to do with the limited use of the physical versions of tokens. Often restricted to specific businesses, organizations, or locations, physical tokens are not easily exchangeable and typically have only one function. With blockchain tokens, these restrictions are lifted—or, more accurately, completely redefinable. Many blockchain tokens serve multiple purposes globally and can be traded for each other or for other currencies on global liquid markets. With the restrictions on use and ownership gone, the \"insignificant value\" expectation is also a thing of the past.\n\n\nIn this chapter, we look at various uses for tokens and how they are created. We also discuss attributes of tokens such as fungibility and intrinsicality. Finally, we examine the standards and technologies that they are based on, and experiment by building our own tokens.\n\n\nHow Tokens Are Used\n\nThe most obvious use of tokens is as digital private currencies. However, this is only one possible use. Tokens can be programmed to serve many different functions, often overlapping. For example, a token can simultaneously convey a voting right, an access right, and ownership of a resource. As the following list shows, currency is just the first \"app\":\n\n\n\nCurrency\n\nA token can serve as a form of currency, with a value determined through private trade.\n\nResource\n\nA token can represent a resource earned or produced in a sharing economy or resource-sharing environment; for example, a storage or CPU token representing resources that can be shared over a network.\n\nAsset\n\nA token can represent ownership of an intrinsic or extrinsic, tangible or intangible asset; for example, gold, real estate, a car, oil, energy, MMOG items, etc.\n\nAccess\n\nA token can represent access rights and grant access to a digital or physical property, such as a discussion forum, an exclusive website, a hotel room, or a rental car.\n\nEquity\n\nA token can represent shareholder equity in a digital organization (e.g., a DAO) or legal entity (e.g., a corporation).\n\nVoting\n\nA token can represent voting rights in a digital or legal system.\n\nCollectible\n\nA token can represent a digital collectible (e.g., CryptoPunks) or physical collectible (e.g., a painting).\n\nIdentity\n\nA token can represent a digital identity (e.g., avatar) or legal identity (e.g., national ID).\n\nAttestation\n\nA token can represent a certification or attestation of fact by some authority or by a decentralized reputation system (e.g., marriage record, birth certificate, college degree).\n\nUtility\n\nA token can be used to access or pay for a service.\n\n\n\n\nOften, a single token encompasses several of these functions. Sometimes it is hard to discern between them, as the physical equivalents have always been inextricably linked. For example, in the physical world, a driver’s license (attestation) is also an identity document (identity) and the two cannot be separated. In the digital realm, previously commingled functions can be separated and developed independently (e.g., an anonymous attestation).\n\n\n\nTokens and Fungibility\n\nWikipedia says: \"In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.\"\n\n\nTokens are fungible when we can substitute any single unit of the token for another without any difference in its value or function.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, if a token’s historical provenance can be tracked, then it is not entirely fungible. The ability to track provenance can lead to blacklisting and whitelisting, reducing or eliminating fungibility.\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens are tokens that each represent a unique tangible or intangible item and therefore are not interchangeable. For example, a token that represents ownership of a specific Van Gogh painting is not equivalent to another token that represents a Picasso, even though they might be part of the same \"art ownership token\" system. Similarly, a token representing a specific digital collectible such as a specific CryptoKitty is not interchangeable with any other CryptoKitty. Each non-fungible token is associated with a unique identifier, such as a serial number.\n\n\nWe will see examples of both fungible and non-fungible tokens later in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that \"fungible\" is often used to mean \"directly exchangeable for money\" (for example, a casino token can be \"cashed in,\" while laundry tokens typically cannot). This is not the sense in which we use the word here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterparty Risk\n\nCounterparty risk is the risk that the other party in a transaction will fail to meet their obligations. Some types of transactions suffer additional counterparty risk because there are more than two parties involved. For example, if you hold a certificate of deposit for a precious metal and you sell that to someone, there are at least three parties in that transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the custodian of the precious metal. Someone holds the physical asset; by necessity they become party to the fulfillment of the transaction and add counterparty risk to any transaction involving that asset. In general, when an asset is traded indirectly through the exchange of a token of ownership, there is additional counterparty risk from the custodian of the asset. Do they have the asset? Will they recognize (or allow) the transfer of ownership based on the transfer of a token (such as a certificate, deed, title, or digital token)? In the world of digital tokens representing assets, as in the nondigital world, it is important to understand who holds the asset that is represented by the token and what rules apply to that underlying asset.\n\n\n\nTokens and Intrinsicality\n\nThe word \"intrinsic\" derives from the Latin \"intra,\" meaning \"from within.\"\n\n\nSome tokens represent digital items that are intrinsic to the blockchain. Those digital assets are governed by consensus rules, just like the tokens themselves. This has an important implication: tokens that represent intrinsic assets do not carry additional counterparty risk. If you hold the keys for a CryptoKitty, there is no other party holding that CryptoKitty for you—you own it directly. The blockchain consensus rules apply and your ownership (i.e., control) of the private keys is equivalent to ownership of the asset, without any intermediary.\n\n\nConversely, many tokens are used to represent extrinsic things, such as real estate, corporate voting shares, trademarks, and gold bars. The ownership of these items, which are not \"within\" the blockchain, is governed by law, custom, and policy, separate from the consensus rules that govern the token. In other words, token issuers and owners may still depend on real-world non-smart contracts. As a result, these extrinsic assets carry additional counterparty risk because they are held by custodians, recorded in external registries, or controlled by laws and policies outside the blockchain environment.\n\n\nOne of the most important ramifications of blockchain-based tokens is the ability to convert extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets and thereby remove counterparty risk. A good example is moving from equity in a corporation (extrinsic) to an equity or voting token in a DAO or similar (intrinsic) organization.\n\n\n\nUsing Tokens: Utility or Equity\n\nAlmost all projects in Ethereum today launch with some kind of token. But do all these projects really need tokens? Are there any disadvantages to using a token, or will we see the slogan \"tokenize all the things\" come to fruition? In principle, the use of tokens can be seen as the ultimate management or organization tool. In practice, the integration of blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, into the existing structures of society means that, so far, there are many limitations to their applicability.\n\n\nLet’s start by clarifying the role of a token in a new project. The majority of projects are using tokens in one of two ways: either as \"utility tokens\" or as \"equity tokens.\" Very often, those two roles are conflated.\n\n\nUtility tokens are those where the use of the token is required to gain access to a service, application, or resource. Examples of utility tokens include tokens that represent resources such as shared storage, or access to services such as social media networks.\n\n\nEquity tokens are those that represent shares in the control or ownership of something, such as a startup. Equity tokens can be as limited as nonvoting shares for distribution of dividends and profits, or as expansive as voting shares in a decentralized autonomous organization, where management of the platform is through some complex governance system based on votes by the token holders.\n\n\nIt’s a Duck!\n\nMany startups face a difficult problem: tokens are a great fundraising mechanism, but offering securities (equity) to the public is a regulated activity in most jurisdictions. By disguising equity tokens as utility tokens, many startups hope to get around these regulatory restrictions and raise money from a public offering while presenting it as a pre-sale of \"service access vouchers\" or, as we call them, utility tokens. Whether these thinly disguised equity offerings will be able to skirt the regulators remains to be seen.\n\n\nAs the popular saying goes: \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.\" Regulators are not likely to be distracted by these semantic contortions; quite the opposite, they are more likely to see such legal sophistry as an attempt to deceive the public.\n\n\n\nUtility Tokens: Who Needs Them?\n\nThe real problem is that utility tokens introduce significant risks and adoption barriers for startups. Perhaps in a distant future \"tokenize all the things\" will become reality, but at present the set of people who have an understanding of and desire to use a token is a subset of the already small cryptocurrency market.\n\n\nFor a startup, each innovation represents a risk and a market filter. Innovation is taking the road least traveled, walking away from the path of tradition. It is already a lonely walk. If a startup is trying to innovate in a new area of technology, such as storage sharing over P2P networks, that is a lonely enough path. Adding a utility token to that innovation and requiring users to adopt tokens in order to use the service compounds the risk and increases the barriers to adoption. It’s walking off the already lonely trail of P2P storage innovation and into the wilderness.\n\n\nThink of each innovation as a filter. It limits adoption to the subset of the market that can become early adopters of this innovation. Adding a second filter compounds that effect, further limiting the addressable market. You are asking your early adopters to adopt not one but two completely new technologies: the novel application/platform/service you built, and the token economy.\n\n\nFor a startup, each innovation introduces risks that increase the chance of failure of the startup. If you take your already risky startup idea and add a utility token, you are adding all the risks of the underlying platform (Ethereum), broader economy (exchanges, liquidity), regulatory environment (equity/commodity regulators), and technology (smart contracts, token standards). That’s a lot of risk for a startup.\n\n\nAdvocates of \"tokenize all the things\" will likely counter that by adopting tokens they are also inheriting the market enthusiasm, early adopters, technology, innovation, and liquidity of the entire token economy. That is true too. The question is whether the benefits and enthusiasm outweigh the risks and uncertainties.\n\n\nNevertheless, some of the most innovative business ideas are indeed taking place in the crypto realm. If regulators are not quick enough to adopt laws and support new business models, entrepreneurs and associated talent will seek to operate in other jurisdictions that are more crypto-friendly. This is already happening.\n\n\nFinally, at the beginning of this chapter, when introducing tokens, we discussed the colloquial meaning of \"token\" as \"something of insignificant value.\" The underlying reason for the insignificant value of most tokens is because they can only be used in a very narrow context: one bus company, one laundromat, one arcade, one hotel, or one company store. Limited liquidity, limited applicability, and high conversion costs reduce the value of tokens until they are only of \"token\" value. So when you add a utility token to your platform, but the token can only be used on your single platform with a small market, you are recreating the conditions that made physical tokens worthless. This may indeed be the correct way to incorporate tokenization into your project. However, if in order to use your platform a user has to convert something into your utility token, use it, and then convert the remainder back into something more generally useful, you’ve created a company scrip. The switching costs of a digital token are orders of magnitude lower than for a physical token without a market, but they are not zero. Utility tokens that work across an entire industry sector will be very interesting and probably quite valuable. But if you set up your startup to have to bootstrap an entire industry standard in order to succeed, you may have already failed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the benefits of deploying services on general-purpose platforms like Ethereum is being able to connect smart contracts (and therefore the utility of tokens) across projects, increasing the potential for liquidity and utility of tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake this decision for the right reasons. Adopt a token because your application cannot work without a token. Adopt it because the token lifts a fundamental market barrier or solves an access problem. Don’t introduce a utility token because it is the only way you can raise money fast and you need to pretend it’s not a public securities offering.\n\n\n\n\nTokens on Ethereum\n\nBlockchain tokens existed before Ethereum. In some ways, the first blockchain currency, Bitcoin, is a token itself. Many token platforms were also developed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before Ethereum. However, the introduction of the first token standard on Ethereum led to an explosion of tokens.\n\n\nVitalik Buterin suggested tokens as one of the most obvious and useful applications of a generalized programmable blockchain such as Ethereum. In fact, in the first year of Ethereum, it was common to see Vitalik and others wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Ethereum logo and a smart contract sample on the back. There were several variations of this T-shirt, but the most common showed an implementation of a token.\n\n\nBefore we delve into the details of creating tokens on Ethereum, it is important to have an overview of how tokens work on Ethereum. Tokens are different from ether because the Ethereum protocol does not know anything about them. Sending ether is an intrinsic action of the Ethereum platform, but sending or even owning tokens is not. The ether balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the protocol level, whereas the token balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the smart contract level. In order to create a new token on Ethereum, you must create a new smart contract. Once deployed, the smart contract handles everything, including ownership, transfers, and access rights. You can write your smart contract to perform all the necessary actions any way you want, but it is probably wisest to follow an existing standard. We will look at such standards next. We discuss the pros and cons of the following standards at the end of the chapter.\n\n\nThe ERC20 Token Standard\n\nThe first standard was introduced in November 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller as an Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC). It was automatically assigned GitHub issue number 20, giving rise to the name \"ERC20 token.\" The vast majority of tokens are currently based on the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 request for comments eventually became Ethereum Improvement Proposal 20 (EIP-20), but it is mostly still referred to by the original name, ERC20.\n\n\nERC20 is a standard for fungible tokens, meaning that different units of an ERC20 token are interchangeable and have no unique properties.\n\n\nThe ERC20 standard defines a common interface for contracts implementing a token, such that any compatible token can be accessed and used in the same way. The interface consists of a number of functions that must be present in every implementation of the standard, as well as some optional functions and attributes that may be added by developers.\n\n\nERC20 required functions and events\n\nAn ERC20-compliant token contract must provide at least the following functions and events:\n\n\n\ntotalSupply\n\nReturns the total units of this token that currently exist. ERC20 tokens can have a fixed or a variable supply.\n\nbalanceOf\n\nGiven an address, returns the token balance of that address.\n\ntransfer\n\nGiven an address and amount, transfers that amount of tokens to that address, from the balance of the address that executed the transfer.\n\ntransferFrom\n\nGiven a sender, recipient, and amount, transfers tokens from one account to another. Used in combination with approve.\n\napprove\n\nGiven a recipient address and amount, authorizes that address to execute several transfers up to that amount, from the account that issued the approval.\n\nallowance\n\nGiven an owner address and a spender address, returns the remaining amount that the spender is approved to withdraw from the owner.\n\nTransfer\n\nEvent triggered upon a successful transfer (call to transfer or transferFrom) (even for zero-value transfers).\n\nApproval\n\nEvent logged upon a successful call to approve.\n\n\n\n\n\nERC20 optional functions\n\nIn addition to the required functions listed in the previous section, the following optional functions are also defined by the standard:\n\n\n\nname\n\nReturns the human-readable name (e.g., \"US Dollars\") of the token.\n\nsymbol\n\nReturns a human-readable symbol (e.g., \"USD\") for the token.\n\ndecimals\n\nReturns the number of decimals used to divide token amounts. For example, if decimals is 2, then the token amount is divided by 100 to get its user representation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ERC20 interface defined in Solidity\n\nHere’s what an ERC20 interface specification looks like in Solidity:\n\n\n\ncontract ERC20 {\n   function totalSupply() constant returns (uint theTotalSupply);\n   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);\n   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns\n      (bool success);\n   function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n   function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns\n      (uint remaining);\n   event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);\n   event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);\n}\n\n\n\n\nERC20 data structures\n\nIf you examine any ERC20 implementation you will see that it contains two data structures, one to track balances and one to track allowances. In Solidity, they are implemented with a data mapping.\n\n\nThe first data mapping implements an internal table of token balances, by owner. This allows the token contract to keep track of who owns the tokens. Each transfer is a deduction from one balance and an addition to another balance:\n\n\n\nmapping(address => uint256) balances;\n\n\n\nThe second data structure is a data mapping of allowances. As we will see in the next section, with ERC20 tokens an owner of a token can delegate authority to a spender, allowing them to spend a specific amount (allowance) from the owner’s balance. The ERC20 contract keeps track of the allowances with a two-dimensional mapping, with the primary key being the address of the token owner, mapping to a spender address and an allowance amount:\n\n\n\nmapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowed;\n\n\n\n\nERC20 workflows: \"transfer\" and \"approve & transferFrom\"\n\nThe ERC20 token standard has two transfer functions. You might be wondering why.\n\n\nERC20 allows for two different workflows. The first is a single-transaction, straightforward workflow using the transfer function. This workflow is the one used by wallets to send tokens to other wallets. The vast majority of token transactions happen with the transfer workflow.\n\n\nExecuting the transfer contract is very simple. If Alice wants to send 10 tokens to Bob, her wallet sends a transaction to the token contract’s address, calling the transfer function with Bob’s address and 10 as the arguments. The token contract adjusts Alice’s balance (–10) and Bob’s balance (+10) and issues a Transfer event.\n\n\nThe second workflow is a two-transaction workflow that uses approve followed by transferFrom. This workflow allows a token owner to delegate their control to another address. It is most often used to delegate control to a contract for distribution of tokens, but it can also be used by exchanges.\n\n\nFor example, if a company is selling tokens for an ICO, they can approve a crowdsale contract address to distribute a certain amount of tokens. The crowdsale contract can then transferFrom the token contract owner’s balance to each buyer of the token, as illustrated in The two-step approve & transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a crowdfunding mechanism used by companies and organizations to raise money by selling tokens. The term is derived from Initial Public Offering (IPO), which is the process by which a public company offers shares for sale to investors on a stock exchange. Unlike the highly regulated IPO markets, ICOs are open, global, and messy. The examples and explanations of ICOs in this book are not an endorsement of this type of fundraising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The two-step approve & transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens\n\n\nFor the approve & transferFrom workflow, two transactions are needed. Let’s say that Alice wants to allow the AliceICO contract to sell 50% of all the AliceCoin tokens to buyers like Bob and Charlie. First, Alice launches the AliceCoin ERC20 contract, issuing all the AliceCoin to her own address. Then, Alice launches the AliceICO contract that can sell tokens for ether. Next, Alice initiates the approve & transferFrom workflow. She sends a transaction to the AliceCoin contract, calling approve with the address of the AliceICO contract and 50% of the totalSupply as arguments. This will trigger the Approval event. Now, the AliceICO contract can sell AliceCoin.\n\n\nWhen the AliceICO contract receives ether from Bob, it needs to send some AliceCoin to Bob in return. Within the AliceICO contract is an exchange rate between AliceCoin and ether. The exchange rate that Alice set when she created the AliceICO contract determines how many tokens Bob will receive for the amount of ether sent to the AliceICO contract. When the AliceICO contract calls the AliceCoin transferFrom function, it sets Alice’s address as the sender and Bob’s address as the recipient, and uses the exchange rate to determine how many AliceCoin tokens will be transferred to Bob in the value field. The AliceCoin contract transfers the balance from Alice’s address to Bob’s address and triggers a Transfer event. The AliceICO contract can call transferFrom an unlimited number of times, as long as it doesn’t exceed the approval limit Alice set. The AliceICO contract can keep track of how many AliceCoin tokens it can sell by calling the allowance function.\n\n\n\nERC20 implementations\n\nWhile it is possible to implement an ERC20-compatible token in about 30 lines of Solidity code, most implementations are more complex. This is to account for potential security vulnerabilities. There are two implementations mentioned in the EIP-20 standard:\n\n\n\nConsensys EIP20\n\nA simple and easy-to-read implementation of an ERC20-compatible token.\n\nOpenZeppelin StandardToken\n\nThis implementation is ERC20-compatible, with additional security precautions. It forms the basis of OpenZeppelin libraries implementing more complex ERC20-compatible tokens with fundraising caps, auctions, vesting schedules, and other features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching Our Own ERC20 Token\n\nLet’s create and launch our own token. For this example, we will use the Truffle framework. The example assumes you have already installed truffle and configured it, and are familiar with its basic operation (for details, see [truffle]).\n\n\nWe will call our token \"Mastering Ethereum Token,” with the symbol \"MET.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can find this example in the book’s GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s create and initialize a Truffle project directory. Run these four commands and accept the default answers to any questions:\n\n\n$ mkdir METoken\n$ cd METoken\nMEToken $ truffle init\nMEToken $ npm init\n\n\nYou should now have the following directory structure:\n\n\n\nMEToken/\n+---- contracts\n|   `---- Migrations.sol\n+---- migrations\n|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js\n+---- package.json\n+---- test\n+---- truffle-config.js\n`---- truffle.js\n\n\n\nEdit the truffle.js or truffle-config.js configuration file to set up your Truffle environment, or copy the latter from the repository.\n\n\nIf you use the example truffle-config.js, remember to create a file .env in the METoken folder containing your test private keys for testing and deployment on public Ethereum test networks, such as Ropsten or Kovan. You can export your test network private key from MetaMask.\n\n\nAfter that your directory should look like:\n\n\n\nMEToken/\n+---- contracts\n|   `---- Migrations.sol\n+---- migrations\n|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js\n+---- package.json\n+---- test\n+---- truffle-config.js\n+---- truffle.js\n`---- .env *new file*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOnly use test keys or test mnemonics that are not used to hold funds on the main Ethereum network. Never use keys that hold real money for testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our example, we will import the OpenZeppelin library, which implements some important security checks and is easy to extend:\n\n\n$ npm install openzeppelin-solidity@1.12.0\n\n+ openzeppelin-solidity@1.12.0\nadded 1 package from 1 contributor and audited 2381 packages in 4.074s\n\n\nThe openzeppelin-solidity package will add about 250 files under the node_modules directory. The OpenZeppelin library includes a lot more than the ERC20 token, but we will only use a small part of it.\n\n\nNext, let’s write our token contract. Create a new file, METoken.sol, and copy the example code from GitHub.\n\n\nOur contract, shown in METoken.sol: A Solidity contract implementing an ERC20 token, is very simple, as it inherits all its functionality from the OpenZeppelin library.\n\n\nExample 1. METoken.sol: A Solidity contract implementing an ERC20 token\n\n\n\nlink:code/truffle/METoken/contracts/METoken.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we are defining the optional variables name, symbol, and decimals. We also define an _initial_supply variable, set to 21 million tokens; with two decimals of subdivision that gives 2.1 billion total units. In the contract’s initialization (constructor) function we set the totalSupply to be equal to _initial_supply and allocate all of the _initial_supply to the balance of the account (msg.sender) that creates the METoken contract.\n\n\nWe now use truffle to compile the METoken code:\n\n\n$ truffle compile\nCompiling ./contracts/METoken.sol...\nCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...\nCompiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol...\nCompiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/BasicToken.sol...\nCompiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol...\nCompiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Basic.sol...\nCompiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol...\n\n\nAs you can see, truffle incorporates necessary dependencies from the OpenZeppelin libraries and compiles those contracts too.\n\n\nLet’s set up a migration script to deploy the METoken contract. Create a new file called 2_deploy_contracts.js, in the METoken/migrations folder. Copy the contents from the example in the GitHub repository:\n\n\n2_deploy_contracts: Migration to deploy METoken\n\nlink:code/truffle/METoken/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]\n\n\n\nBefore we deploy on one of the Ethereum test networks, let’s start a local blockchain to test everything. Start the ganache blockchain, either from the command line with ganache-cli or from the graphical user interface.\n\n\nOnce ganache is started, we can deploy our METoken contract and see if everything works as expected:\n\n\n$ truffle migrate --network ganache\nUsing network 'ganache'.\n\nRunning migration: 1_initial_migration.js\n  Deploying Migrations...\n  ... 0xb2e90a056dc6ad8e654683921fc613c796a03b89df6760ec1db1084ea4a084eb\n  Migrations: 0x8cdaf0cd259887258bc13a92c0a6da92698644c0\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0xd7bc86d31bee32fa3988f1c1eabce403a1b5d570340a3a9cdba53a472ee8c956\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js\n  Deploying METoken...\n  ... 0xbe9290d59678b412e60ed6aefedb17364f4ad2977cfb2076b9b8ad415c5dc9f0\n  METoken: 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0xf36163615f41ef7ed8f4a8f192149a0bf633fe1a2398ce001bf44c43dc7bdda0\nSaving artifacts...\n\n\nOn the ganache console, we should see that our deployment has created four new transactions, as depicted in METoken deployment on ganache.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. METoken deployment on ganache\n\n\nInteracting with METoken using the Truffle console\n\nWe can interact with our contract on the ganache blockchain using the Truffle console. This is an interactive JavaScript environment that provides access to the Truffle environment and, via web3, to the blockchain. In this case, we will connect the Truffle console to the ganache blockchain:\n\n\n$ truffle console --network ganache\ntruffle(ganache)>\n\n\nThe truffle(ganache)> prompt shows that we are connected to the ganache blockchain and are ready to type our commands. The Truffle console supports all the truffle commands, so we could compile and migrate from the console. We’ve already run those commands, so let’s go directly to the contract itself. The METoken contract exists as a JavaScript object within the Truffle environment. Type **METoken** at the prompt and it will dump the entire contract definition:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken\n{ [Function: TruffleContract]\n  _static_methods:\n\n[...]\n\ncurrentProvider:\n HttpProvider {\n   host: 'http://localhost:7545',\n   timeout: 0,\n   user: undefined,\n   password: undefined,\n   headers: undefined,\n   send: [Function],\n   sendAsync: [Function],\n   _alreadyWrapped: true },\nnetwork_id: '5777' }\n\n\nThe METoken object also exposes several attributes, such as the address of the contract (as deployed by the migrate command):\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.address\n'0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10'\n\n\nIf we want to interact with the deployed contract, we have to use an asynchronous call, in the form of a JavaScript \"promise.\" We use the deployed function to get the contract instance and then call the totalSupply function:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => instance.totalSupply())\nBigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2100000000 ] }\n\n\nNext, let’s use the accounts created by ganache to check our METoken balance and send some METoken to another address. First, let’s get the account addresses:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> let accounts\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> web3.eth.getAccounts((err,res) => { accounts = res })\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> accounts[0]\n'0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57'\n\n\nThe accounts list now contains all the accounts created by ganache, and account[0] is the account that deployed the METoken contract. It should have a balance of METoken, because our METoken constructor gives the entire token supply to the address that created it. Let’s check:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]).then(console.log) })\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2100000000 ] }\n\n\nFinally, let’s transfer 1000.00 METoken from account[0] to account[1], by calling the contract’s transfer function:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.transfer(accounts[1], 100000) })\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]).then(console.log) })\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2099900000 ] }\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(accounts[1]).then(console.log) })\nundefined\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 5, c: [ 100000 ] }\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMEToken has 2 decimals of precision, meaning that 1 METoken is 100 units in the contract. When we transfer 1,000 METoken, we specify the value as 100000 in the call to the transfer function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, in the console, account[0] now has 20,999,000 MET, and account[1] has 1,000 MET.\n\n\nIf you switch to the ganache graphical user interface, as shown in METoken transfer on ganache, you will see the transaction that called the transfer function.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. METoken transfer on ganache\n\n\n\nSending ERC20 tokens to contract addresses\n\nSo far, we’ve set up an ERC20 token and transferred some tokens from one account to another. All the accounts we used for these demonstrations are externally owned accounts, meaning they are controlled by a private key, not a contract. What happens if we send MET to a contract address? Let’s find out!\n\n\nFirst, let’s deploy another contract into our test environment. For this example, we will use our first contract, Faucet.sol. Let’s add it to the METoken project by copying it to the contracts directory. Our directory should look like this:\n\n\n\nMEToken/\n+---- contracts\n|   +---- Faucet.sol\n|   +---- METoken.sol\n|   `---- Migrations.sol\n\n\n\nWe’ll also add a migration, to deploy Faucet separately from METoken:\n\n\n\nvar Faucet = artifacts.require(\"Faucet\");\n\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\n  // Deploy the Faucet contract as our only task\n  deployer.deploy(Faucet);\n};\n\n\n\nLet’s compile and migrate the contracts from the Truffle console:\n\n\n$ truffle console --network ganache\ntruffle(ganache)> compile\nCompiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...\nWriting artifacts to ./build/contracts\n\ntruffle(ganache)> migrate\nUsing network 'ganache'.\n\nRunning migration: 1_initial_migration.js\n  Deploying Migrations...\n  ... 0x89f6a7bd2a596829c60a483ec99665c7af71e68c77a417fab503c394fcd7a0c9\n  Migrations: 0xa1ccce36fb823810e729dce293b75f40fb6ea9c9\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js\n  Replacing METoken...\n  ... 0x28d0da26f48765f67e133e99dd275fac6a25fdfec6594060fd1a0e09a99b44ba\n  METoken: 0x7d6bf9d5914d37bcba9d46df7107e71c59f3791f\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 3_deploy_faucet.js\n  Deploying Faucet...\n  ... 0x6fbf283bcc97d7c52d92fd91f6ac02d565f5fded483a6a0f824f66edc6fa90c3\n  Faucet: 0xb18a42e9468f7f1342fa3c329ec339f254bc7524\nSaving artifacts...\n\n\nGreat. Now let’s send some MET to the Faucet contract:\n\n\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.transfer(Faucet.address, 100000) })\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(Faucet.address).then(console.log)})\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 5, c: [ 100000 ] }\n\n\nAlright, we have transferred 1,000 MET to the Faucet contract. Now, how do we withdraw those tokens?\n\n\nRemember, Faucet.sol is a pretty simple contract. It only has one function, withdraw, which is for withdrawing ether. It doesn’t have a function for withdrawing MET, or any other ERC20 token. If we use withdraw it will try to send ether, but since Faucet doesn’t have a balance of ether yet, it will fail.\n\n\nThe METoken contract knows that Faucet has a balance, but the only way that it can transfer that balance is if it receives a transfer call from the address of the contract. Somehow we need to make the Faucet contract call the transfer function in METoken.\n\n\nIf you’re wondering what to do next, don’t. There is no solution to this problem. The MET sent to Faucet is stuck, forever. Only the Faucet contract can transfer it, and the Faucet contract doesn’t have code to call the transfer function of an ERC20 token contract.\n\n\nPerhaps you anticipated this problem. Most likely, you didn’t. In fact, neither did hundreds of Ethereum users who accidentally transferred various tokens to contracts that didn’t have any ERC20 capability. According to some estimates, tokens worth more than roughly $2.5 million USD (at the time of writing) have gotten \"stuck\" like this and are lost forever.\n\n\nOne of the ways that users of ERC20 tokens can inadvertently lose their tokens in a transfer, is when they attempt to transfer to an exchange or another service. They copy an Ethereum address from the website of an exchange, thinking they can simply send tokens to it. However, many exchanges publish receiving addresses that are actually contracts! These contracts are only meant to receive ether, not ERC20 tokens, most often sweeping all funds sent to them to \"cold storage\" or another centralized wallet. Despite the many warnings saying \"do not send tokens to this address,\" lots of tokens are lost this way.\n\n\n\nDemonstrating the “approve & transferFrom” workflow\n\nOur Faucet contract couldn’t handle ERC20 tokens. Sending tokens to it using the transfer function resulted in the loss of those tokens. Let’s rewrite the contract now and make it handle ERC20 tokens. Specifically, we will turn it into a faucet that gives out MET to anyone who asks.\n\n\nFor this example, we’ll make a copy of the truffle project directory (we’ll call it METoken_METFaucet), initialize truffle and npm, install the OpenZeppelin dependencies, and copy the METoken.sol contract. See our first example, in Launching Our Own ERC20 Token, for the detailed instructions.\n\n\nOur new faucet contract, METFaucet.sol, will look like METFaucet.sol: A faucet for METoken.\n\n\nExample 2. METFaucet.sol: A faucet for METoken\n\n\n\nlink:code/truffle/METoken_METFaucet/contracts/METFaucet.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve made quite a few changes to the basic Faucet example. Since METFaucet will use the transferFrom function in METoken, it will need two additional variables. One will hold the address of the deployed METoken contract. The other will hold the address of the owner of the MET, who will approve the faucet withdrawals. The METFaucet contract will call METoken.transferFrom and instruct it to move MET from the owner to the address where the faucet withdrawal request came from.\n\n\nWe declare these two variables here:\n\n\n\nStandardToken public METoken;\naddress public METOwner;\n\n\n\nSince our faucet needs to be initialized with the correct addresses for METoken and METOwner, we need to declare a custom constructor:\n\n\n\n// METFaucet constructor - provide the address of the METoken contract and\n// the owner address we will be approved to transferFrom\nfunction METFaucet(address _METoken, address _METOwner) public {\n\n\t// Initialize the METoken from the address provided\n\tMEToken = StandardToken(_METoken);\n\tMETOwner = _METOwner;\n}\n\n\n\nThe next change is to the withdraw function. Instead of calling transfer, METFaucet uses the transferFrom function in METoken and asks METoken to transfer MET to the faucet recipient:\n\n\n\n// Use the transferFrom function of METoken\nMEToken.transferFrom(METOwner, msg.sender, withdraw_amount);\n\n\n\nFinally, since our faucet no longer sends ether, we should probably prevent anyone from sending ether to METFaucet, as we wouldn’t want it to get stuck. We change the fallback payable function to reject incoming ether, using the revert function to revert any incoming payments:\n\n\n\n// REJECT any incoming ether\nfunction () public payable { revert(); }\n\n\n\nNow that our METFaucet.sol code is ready, we need to modify the migration script to deploy it. This migration script will be a bit more complex, as METFaucet depends on the address of METoken. We will use a JavaScript promise to deploy the two contracts in sequence. Create 2_deploy_contracts.js as follows:\n\n\n\nvar METoken = artifacts.require(\"METoken\");\nvar METFaucet = artifacts.require(\"METFaucet\");\nvar owner = web3.eth.accounts[0];\n\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\n\n\t// Deploy the METoken contract first\n\tdeployer.deploy(METoken, {from: owner}).then(function() {\n\t\t// Then deploy METFaucet and pass the address of METoken and the\n\t\t// address of the owner of all the MET who will approve METFaucet\n\t\treturn deployer.deploy(METFaucet, METoken.address, owner);\n  \t});\n}\n\n\n\nNow, we can test everything in the Truffle console. First, we use migrate to deploy the contracts. When METoken is deployed it will allocate all the MET to the account that created it, web3.eth.accounts[0]. Then, we call the approve function in METoken to approve METFaucet to send up to 1,000 MET on behalf of web3.eth.accounts[0]. Finally, to test our faucet, we call METFaucet.withdraw from web3.eth.accounts[1] and try to withdraw 10 MET. Here are the console commands:\n\n\n$ truffle console --network ganache\ntruffle(ganache)> migrate\nUsing network 'ganache'.\n\nRunning migration: 1_initial_migration.js\n  Deploying Migrations...\n  ... 0x79352b43e18cc46b023a779e9a0d16b30f127bfa40266c02f9871d63c26542c7\n  Migrations: 0xaa588d3737b611bafd7bd713445b314bd453a5c8\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js\n  Replacing METoken...\n  ... 0xc42a57f22cddf95f6f8c19d794c8af3b2491f568b38b96fef15b13b6e8bfff21\n  METoken: 0xf204a4ef082f5c04bb89f7d5e6568b796096735a\n  Replacing METFaucet...\n  ... 0xd9615cae2fa4f1e8a377de87f86162832cf4d31098779e6e00df1ae7f1b7f864\n  METFaucet: 0x75c35c980c0d37ef46df04d31a140b65503c0eed\nSaving artifacts...\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.approve(METFaucet.address, 100000) })\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(web3.eth.accounts[1]).then(console.log) })\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 0 ] }\ntruffle(ganache)> METFaucet.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.withdraw(1000, {from:web3.eth.accounts[1]}) } )\ntruffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance =>\n                  { instance.balanceOf(web3.eth.accounts[1]).then(console.log) })\ntruffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 3, c: [ 1000 ] }\n\n\nAs you can see from the results, we can use the approve & transferFrom workflow to authorize one contract to transfer tokens defined in another token. If properly used, ERC20 tokens can be used by EOAs and other contracts.\n\n\nHowever, the burden of managing ERC20 tokens correctly is pushed to the user interface. If a user incorrectly attempts to transfer ERC20 tokens to a contract address and that contract is not equipped to receive ERC20 tokens, the tokens will be lost.\n\n\n\n\nIssues with ERC20 Tokens\n\nThe adoption of the ERC20 token standard has been truly explosive. Thousands of tokens have been launched, both to experiment with new capabilities and to raise funds in various \"crowdfund\" auctions and ICOs. However, there are some potential pitfalls, as we saw with the issue of transferring tokens to contract addresses.\n\n\nOne of the less obvious issues with ERC20 tokens is that they expose subtle differences between tokens and ether itself. Where ether is transferred by a transaction that has a recipient address as its destination, token transfers occur within the specific token contract state and have the token contract as their destination, not the recipient’s address. The token contract tracks balances and issues events. In a token transfer, no transaction is actually sent to the recipient of the token. Instead, the recipient’s address is added to a map within the token contract itself. A transaction sending ether to an address changes the state of an address. A transaction transferring a token to an address only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address. Even a wallet that has support for ERC20 tokens does not become aware of a token balance unless the user explicitly adds a specific token contract to \"watch.\" Some wallets watch the most popular token contracts to detect balances held by addresses they control, but that’s limited to a small fraction of existing ERC20 contracts.\n\n\nIn fact, it’s unlikely that a user would want to track all balances in all possible ERC20 token contracts. Many ERC20 tokens are more like email spam than usable tokens. They automatically create balances for accounts that have ether activity, in order to attract users. If you have an Ethereum address with a long history of activity, especially if it was created in the presale, you will find it full of \"junk\" tokens that appeared out of nowhere. Of course, the address isn’t really full of tokens; it’s the token contracts that have your address in them. You only see these balances if these token contracts are being watched by the block explorer or wallet you use to view your address.\n\n\nTokens don’t behave the same way as ether. Ether is sent with the send function and accepted by any payable function in a contract or any externally owned address. Tokens are sent using transfer or approve & transferFrom functions that exist only in the ERC20 contract, and do not (at least in ERC20) trigger any payable functions in a recipient contract. Tokens are meant to function just like a cryptocurrency such as ether, but they come with certain differences that break that illusion.\n\n\nConsider another issue. To send ether or use any Ethereum contract you need ether to pay for gas. To send tokens, you also need ether. You cannot pay for a transaction’s gas with a token and the token contract can’t pay for the gas for you. This may change at some point in the distant future, but in the meantime this can cause some rather strange user experiences. For example, let’s say you use an exchange or ShapeShift to convert some bitcoin to a token. You \"receive\" the token in a wallet that tracks that token’s contract and shows your balance. It looks the same as any of the other cryptocurrencies you have in your wallet. Try sending the token, though, and your wallet will inform you that you need ether to do that. You might be confused—after all, you didn’t need ether to receive the token. Perhaps you have no ether. Perhaps you didn’t even know the token was an ERC20 token on Ethereum; maybe you thought it was a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain. The illusion just broke.\n\n\nSome of these issues are specific to ERC20 tokens. Others are more general issues that relate to abstraction and interface boundaries within Ethereum. Some can be solved by changing the token interface, while others may need changes to fundamental structures within Ethereum (such as the distinction between EOAs and contracts, and between transactions and messages). Some may not be \"solvable\" exactly and may require user interface design to hide the nuances and make the user experience consistent regardless of the underlying distinctions.\n\n\nIn the next sections we will look at various proposals that attempt to address some of these issues.\n\n\n\nERC223: A Proposed Token Contract Interface Standard\n\nThe ERC223 proposal attempts to solve the problem of inadvertent transfer of tokens to a contract (that may or may not support tokens) by detecting whether the destination address is a contract or not. ERC223 requires that contracts designed to accept tokens implement a function named tokenFallback. If the destination of a transfer is a contract and the contract does not have support for tokens (i.e., does not implement tokenFallback), the transfer fails.\n\n\nTo detect whether the destination address is a contract, the ERC223 reference implementation uses a small segment of inline bytecode in a rather creative way:\n\n\n\nfunction isContract(address _addr) private view returns (bool is_contract) {\n  uint length;\n    assembly {\n       // retrieve the size of the code on target address; this needs assembly\n       length := extcodesize(_addr)\n    }\n    return (length>0);\n}\n\n\n\nThe ERC223 contract interface specification is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC223Token {\n  uint public totalSupply;\n  function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint);\n\n  function name() public view returns (string _name);\n  function symbol() public view returns (string _symbol);\n  function decimals() public view returns (uint8 _decimals);\n  function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 _supply);\n\n  function transfer(address to, uint value) public returns (bool ok);\n  function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data) public returns (bool ok);\n  function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data, string custom_fallback)\n      public returns (bool ok);\n\n  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value,\n                 bytes indexed data);\n}\n\n\n\nERC223 is not widely implemented, and there is some debate in the ERC discussion thread about backward compatibility and trade-offs between implementing changes at the contract interface level versus the user interface. The debate continues.\n\n\n\nERC777: A Proposed Token Contract Interface Standard\n\nAnother proposal for an improved token contract standard is ERC777. This proposal has several goals, including:\n\n\n\n\nTo offer an ERC20-compatible interface\n\n\nTo transfer tokens using a send function, similar to ether transfers\n\n\nTo be compatible with ERC820 for token contract registration\n\n\nTo allow contracts and addresses to control which tokens they send through a tokensToSend function that is called prior to sending\n\n\nTo enable contracts and addresses to be notified of the tokens' receipt by calling a tokensReceived function in the recipient, and to reduce the probability of tokens being locked into contracts by requiring contracts to provide a tokensReceived function\n\n\nTo allow existing contracts to use proxy contracts for the tokensToSend and tokensReceived functions\n\n\nTo operate in the same way whether sending to a contract or an EOA\n\n\nTo provide specific events for the minting and burning of tokens\n\n\nTo enable operators (trusted third parties, intended to be verified contracts) to move tokens on behalf of a token holder\n\n\nTo provide metadata on token transfer transactions in userData and operatorData fields\n\n\n\n\nThe ongoing discussion on ERC777 can be found on GitHub.\n\n\nThe ERC777 contract interface specification is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC777Token {\n    function name() public constant returns (string);\n    function symbol() public constant returns (string);\n    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256);\n    function granularity() public constant returns (uint256);\n    function balanceOf(address owner) public constant returns (uint256);\n\n    function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData) public;\n\n    function authorizeOperator(address operator) public;\n    function revokeOperator(address operator) public;\n    function isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder)\n        public constant returns (bool);\n    function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount,\n                          bytes userData,bytes operatorData) public;\n\n    event Sent(address indexed operator, address indexed from,\n               address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes userData,\n               bytes operatorData);\n    event Minted(address indexed operator, address indexed to,\n                 uint256 amount, bytes operatorData);\n    event Burned(address indexed operator, address indexed from,\n                 uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData);\n    event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator,\n                             address indexed tokenHolder);\n    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);\n}\n\n\n\nERC777 hooks\n\nThe ERC777 tokens sender hook specification is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC777TokensSender {\n    function tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to,\n                          uint value, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) public;\n}\n\n\n\nThe implementation of this interface is required for any address wishing to be notified of, to handle, or to prevent the debit of tokens. The address for which the contract implements this interface must be registered via ERC820, whether the contract implements the interface for itself or for another address.\n\n\nThe ERC777 tokens recipient hook specification is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC777TokensRecipient {\n  function tokensReceived(\n     address operator, address from, address to,\n    uint amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData\n  ) public;\n}\n\n\n\nThe implementation of this interface is required for any address wishing to be notified of, to handle, or to reject the reception of tokens. The same logic and requirements apply to the tokens recipient as to the tokens sender interface, with the added constraint that recipient contracts must implement this interface to prevent locking tokens. If the recipient contract does not register an address implementing this interface, the transfer of tokens will fail.\n\n\nAn important aspect is that only one token sender and one token recipient can be registered per address. Hence, for every ERC777 token transfer the same hook functions are called upon debit and reception of every ERC777 token transfer. A specific token can be identified in these functions using the message’s sender, which is the specific token contract address, to handle a particular use case.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the same token sender and token recipient hooks can be registered for multiple addresses and the hooks can distinguish who are the sender and the intended recipient using the from and to parameters.\n\n\nA reference implementation of ERC777 is linked in the proposal. ERC777 depends on a parallel proposal for a registry contract, specified in ERC820. Some of the debate on ERC777 is about the complexity of adopting two big changes at once: a new token standard and a registry standard. The discussion continues.\n\n\n\n\nERC721: Non-fungible Token (Deed) Standard\n\nAll the token standards we have looked at so far are for fungible tokens, meaning that units of a token are interchangeable. The ERC20 token standard only tracks the final balance of each account and does not (explicitly) track the provenance of any token.\n\n\nThe ERC721 proposal is for a standard for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.\n\n\nFrom the Oxford Dictionary:\n\n\n\n\ndeed: A legal document that is signed and delivered, especially one regarding the ownership of property or legal rights.\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word \"deed\" is intended to reflect the \"ownership of property\" part, even though these are not recognized as \"legal documents\" in any jurisdiction—yet. It is likely that at some point in the future, legal ownership based on digital signatures on a blockchain platform will be legally recognized.\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens track ownership of a unique thing. The thing owned can be a digital item, such as an in-game item or digital collectible; or the thing can be a physical item whose ownership is tracked by a token, such as a house, a car, or an artwork. Deeds can also represent things with negative value, such as loans (debt), liens, easements, etc. The ERC721 standard places no limitation or expectation on the nature of the thing whose ownership is tracked by a deed and requires only that it can be uniquely identified, which in the case of this standard is achieved by a 256-bit identifier.\n\n\nThe details of the standard and discussion are tracked in two different GitHub locations:\n\n\n\n\nInitial proposal\n\n\nContinued discussion\n\n\n\n\nTo grasp the basic difference between ERC20 and ERC721, it is sufficient to look at the internal data structure used in ERC721:\n\n\n\n// Mapping from deed ID to owner\nmapping (uint256 => address) private deedOwner;\n\n\n\nWhereas ERC20 tracks the balances that belong to each owner, with the owner being the primary key of the mapping, ERC721 tracks each deed ID and who owns it, with the deed ID being the primary key of the mapping. From this basic difference flow all the properties of a non-fungible token.\n\n\nThe ERC721 contract interface specification is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {\n    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _deedId);\n    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved,\n                   uint256 _deedId);\n    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator,\n                         bool _approved);\n\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 _balance);\n    function ownerOf(uint256 _deedId) external view returns (address _owner);\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _deedId) external payable;\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _deedId)\n        external payable;\n    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _deedId) external payable;\n    function setApprovalForAll(address _operateor, boolean _approved) payable;\n    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);\n}\n\n\n\nERC721 also supports two optional interfaces, one for metadata and one for enumeration of deeds and owners.\n\n\nThe ERC721 optional interface for metadata is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC721Metadata /* is ERC721 */ {\n    function name() external pure returns (string _name);\n    function symbol() external pure returns (string _symbol);\n    function deedUri(uint256 _deedId) external view returns (string _deedUri);\n}\n\n\n\nThe ERC721 optional interface for enumeration is:\n\n\n\ninterface ERC721Enumerable /* is ERC721 */ {\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256 _count);\n    function deedByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256 _deedId);\n    function countOfOwners() external view returns (uint256 _count);\n    function ownerByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (address _owner);\n    function deedOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view\n        returns (uint256 _deedId);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Token Standards\n\nIn the previous section we reviewed several proposed standards and a couple of widely deployed standards for token contracts. What exactly do these standards do? Should you use these standards? How should you use them? Should you add functionality beyond these standards? Which standards should you use? We will examine some of those questions next.\n\n\nWhat Are Token Standards? What Is Their Purpose?\n\nToken standards are the minimum specifications for an implementation. What that means is that in order to be compliant with, say, ERC20, you need to at minimum implement the functions and behavior specified by the ERC20 standard. You are also free to add to the functionality by implementing functions that are not part of the standard.\n\n\nThe primary purpose of these standards is to encourage interoperability between contracts. Thus, all wallets, exchanges, user interfaces, and other infrastructure components can interface in a predictable manner with any contract that follows the specification. In other words, if you deploy a contract that follows the ERC20 standard, all existing wallet users can seamlessly start trading your token without any wallet upgrade or effort on your part.\n\n\nThe standards are meant to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive. How you choose to implement those functions is up to you—the internal functioning of the contract is not relevant to the standard. They have some functional requirements, which govern the behavior under specific circumstances, but they do not prescribe an implementation. An example of this is the behavior of a transfer function if the value is set to zero.\n\n\n\nShould You Use These Standards?\n\nGiven all these standards, each developer faces a dilemma: use the existing standards or innovate beyond the restrictions they impose?\n\n\nThis dilemma is not easy to resolve. Standards necessarily restrict your ability to innovate, by creating a narrow \"rut\" that you have to follow. On the other hand, the basic standards have emerged from experience with hundreds of applications and often fit well with the vast majority of use cases.\n\n\nAs part of this consideration is an even bigger issue: the value of interoperability and broad adoption. If you choose to use an existing standard, you gain the value of all the systems designed to work with that standard. If you choose to depart from the standard, you have to consider the cost of building all of the support infrastructure on your own, or persuading others to support your implementation as a new standard. The tendency to forge your own path and ignore existing standards is known as \"Not Invented Here\" syndrome and is antithetical to open source culture. On the other hand, progress and innovation depend on departing from tradition sometimes. It’s a tricky choice, so consider it carefully!\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPer Wikipedia, “Not Invented Here” is a stance adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures that avoid using or buying already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins and costs, such as royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity by Maturity\n\nBeyond the choice of standard, there is the parallel choice of implementation. When you decide to use a standard such as ERC20, you have to then decide how to implement a compatible design. There are a number of existing \"reference\" implementations that are widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem, or you could write your own from scratch. Again, this choice represents a dilemma that can have serious security implications.\n\n\nExisting implementations are “battle-tested.” While it is impossible to prove that they are secure, many of them underpin millions of dollars' worth of tokens. They have been attacked, repeatedly and vigorously. So far, no significant vulnerabilities have been discovered. Writing your own is not easy—there are many subtle ways that a contract can be compromised. It is much safer to use a well-tested, widely used implementation. In our examples, we used the OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC20 standard, as this implementation is security-focused from the ground up.\n\n\nIf you use an existing implementation you can also extend it. Again, however, be careful with this impulse. Complexity is the enemy of security. Every single line of code you add expands the attack surface of your contract and could represent a vulnerability lying in wait. You may not notice a problem until you put a lot of value on top of the contract and someone breaks it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nStandards and implementation choices are important parts of overall secure smart contract design, but they’re not the only considerations. See [smart_contract_security].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensions to Token Interface Standards\n\nThe token standards discussed in this chapter provide a very minimal interface, with limited functionality. Many projects have created extended implementations to support features that they need for their applications. Some of these features include:\n\n\n\nOwner control\n\nThe ability to give specific addresses, or sets of addresses (i.e., multisignature schemes), special capabilities, such as blacklisting, whitelisting, minting, recovery, etc.\n\nBurning\n\nThe ability to deliberately destroy (“burn”) tokens by transferring them to an unspendable address or by erasing a balance and reducing the supply.\n\nMinting\n\nThe ability to add to the total supply of tokens, at a predictable rate or by \"fiat\" of the creator of the token.\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nThe ability to offer tokens for sale, for example through an auction, market sale, reverse auction, etc.\n\nCaps\n\nThe ability to set predefined and immutable limits on the total supply (the opposite of the \"minting\" feature).\n\nRecovery backdoors\n\nFunctions to recover funds, reverse transfers, or dismantle the token that can be activated by a designated address or set of addresses.\n\nWhitelisting\n\nThe ability to restrict actions (such as token transfers) to specific addresses. Most commonly used to offer tokens to \"accredited investors\" after vetting by the rules of different jurisdictions. There is usually a mechanism for updating the whitelist.\n\nBlacklisting\n\nThe ability to restrict token transfers by disallowing specific addresses. There is usually a function for updating the blacklist.\n\n\n\n\nThere are reference implementations for many of these functions, for example in the OpenZeppelin library. Some of these are use case–specific and only implemented in a few tokens. There are, as of now, no widely accepted standards for the interfaces to these functions.\n\n\nAs previously discussed, the decision to extend a token standard with additional functionality represents a trade-off between innovation/risk and interoperability/security.\n\n\n\nTokens and ICOs\n\nTokens have been an explosive development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is likely that they will become a very important component of all smart contract platforms like Ethereum.\n\n\nNevertheless, the importance and future impact of these standards should not be confused with an endorsement of current token offerings. As in any early-stage technology, the first wave of products and companies will almost all fail, and some will fail spectacularly. Many of the tokens on offer in Ethereum today are barely disguised scams, pyramid schemes, and money grabs.\n\n\nThe trick is to separate the long-term vision and impact of this technology, which is likely to be huge, from the short-term bubble of token ICOs, which are rife with fraud. Token standards and the platform will survive the current token mania, and then they will likely change the world.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nTokens are a very powerful concept in Ethereum and can form the basis of many important decentralized applications. In this chapter we looked at the different types of tokens and token standards, and you built your first token and related application. We will revisit tokens again in [decentralized_applications_chap], where you will use a non-fungible token as the basis for an auction DApp.\n\n\n\n"},"11oracles.html":{"url":"11oracles.html","title":"Chapter 11: Oracles","keywords":"","body":"\nOracles\n\n\nIn this chapter we discuss oracles, which are systems that can provide external data sources to Ethereum smart contracts. The term \"oracle\" comes from Greek mythology, where it referred to a person in communication with the gods who could see visions of the future. In the context of blockchains, an oracle is a system that can answer questions that are external to Ethereum. Ideally oracles are systems that are trustless, meaning that they do not need to be trusted because they operate on decentralized principles.\n\n\nWhy Oracles Are Needed\n\nA key component of the Ethereum platform is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, with its ability to execute programs and update the state of Ethereum, constrained by consensus rules, on any node in the decentralized network. In order to maintain consensus, EVM execution must be totally deterministic and based only on the shared context of the Ethereum state and signed transactions. This has two particularly important consequences: the first is that there can be no intrinsic source of randomness for the EVM and smart contracts to work with; the second is that extrinsic data can only be introduced as the data payload of a transaction.\n\n\nLet’s unpack those two consequences further. To understand the prohibition of a true random function in the EVM to provide randomness for smart contracts, consider the effect on attempts to achieve consensus after the execution of such a function: node A would execute the command and store 3 on behalf of the smart contract in its storage, while node B, executing the same smart contract, would store 7 instead. Thus, nodes A and B would come to different conclusions about what the resulting state should be, despite having run exactly the same code in the same context. Indeed, it could be that a different resulting state would be achieved every time that the smart contract is evaluated. As such, there would be no way for the network, with its multitude of nodes running independently around the world, to ever come to a decentralized consensus on what the resulting state should be. In practice, it would get much worse than this example very quickly, because knock-on effects, including ether transfers, would build up exponentially.\n\n\nNote that pseudorandom functions, such as cryptographically secure hash functions (which are deterministic and therefore can be, and indeed are, part of the EVM), are not enough for many applications. Take a gambling game that simulates coin flips to resolve bet payouts, which needs to randomize heads or tails—a miner can gain an advantage by playing the game and only including their transactions in blocks for which they will win. So how do we get around this problem? Well, all nodes can agree on the contents of signed transactions, so extrinsic information, including sources of randomness, price information, weather forecasts, etc., can be introduced as the data part of transactions sent to the network. However, such data simply cannot be trusted, because it comes from unverifiable sources. As such, we have just deferred the problem. We use oracles to attempt to solve these problems, which we will discuss in detail, in the rest of this chapter.\n\n\n\nOracle Use Cases and Examples\n\nOracles, ideally, provide a trustless (or at least near-trustless) way of getting extrinsic (i.e., \"rea-world\" or off-chain) information, such as the results of football games, the price of gold, or truly random numbers, onto the Ethereum platform for smart contracts to use. They can also be used to relay data securely to DApp frontends directly. Oracles can therefore be thought of as a mechanism for bridging the gap between the off-chain world and smart contracts. Allowing smart contracts to enforce contractual relationships based on real-world events and data broadens their scope dramatically. However, this can also introduce external risks to Ethereum’s security model. Consider a \"smart will\" contract that distributes assets when a person dies. This is something frequently discussed in the smart contract space, and highlights the risks of a trusted oracle. If the inheritance amount controlled by such a contract is high enough, the incentive to hack the oracle and trigger distribution of assets before the owner dies is very high.\n\n\nNote that some oracles provide data that is particular to a specific private data source, such as academic certificates or government IDs. The source of such data, such as a university or government department, is fully trusted, and the truth of the data is subjective (truth is only determined by appeal to the authority of the source). Such data cannot therefore be provided trustlessly—i.e., without  trusting a source—as there is no independently verifiably objective truth. As such, we include these data sources in our definition of what counts as \"oracles\" because they also provide a data bridge for smart contracts. The data they provide generally takes the form of attestations, such as passports or records of achievement. Attestations will become a big part of the success of blockchain platforms in the future, particularly in relation to the related issues of verifying identity or reputation, so it is important to explore how they can be served by blockchain platforms.\n\n\nSome more examples of data that might be provided by oracles include:\n\n\n\n\nRandom numbers/entropy from physical sources such as quantum/thermal processes: e.g., to fairly select a winner in a lottery smart contract\n\n\nParametric triggers indexed to natural hazards: e.g., triggering of catastrophe bond smart contracts, such as Richter scale measurements for an earthquake bond\n\n\nExchange rate data: e.g., for accurate pegging of cryptocurrencies to fiat currency\n\n\nCapital markets data: e.g., pricing baskets of tokenized assets/securities\n\n\nBenchmark reference data: e.g., incorporating interest rates into smart financial derivatives\n\n\nStatic/pseudostatic data: security identifiers, country codes, currency codes, etc.\n\n\nTime and interval data: for event triggers grounded in precise time measurements\n\n\nWeather data: e.g., insurance premium calculations based on weather forecasts\n\n\nPolitical events: for prediction market resolution\n\n\nSporting events: for prediction market resolution and fantasy sports contracts\n\n\nGeolocation data: e.g., as used in supply chain tracking\n\n\nDamage verification: for insurance contracts\n\n\nEvents occurring on other blockchains: interoperability functions\n\n\nEther market price: e.g., for fiat gas price oracles\n\n\nFlight statistics: e.g., as used by groups and clubs for flight ticket pooling\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we will examine some of the ways oracles can be implemented, including basic oracle patterns, computation oracles, decentralized oracles, and oracle client implementations in Solidity.\n\n\n\nOracle Design Patterns\n\nAll oracles provide a few key functions, by definition. These include the ability to:\n\n\n\n\nCollect data from an off-chain source.\n\n\nTransfer the data on-chain with a signed message.\n\n\nMake the data available by putting it in a smart contract’s storage.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the data is available in a smart contract’s storage, it can be accessed by other smart contracts via message calls that invoke a \"retrieve\" function of the oracle’s smart contract; it can also be accessed by Ethereum nodes or network-enabled clients directly by \"looking into” the oracle’s storage.\n\n\nThe three main ways to set up an oracle can be categorized as request–response, publish-subscribe, and immediate-read.\n\n\nStarting with the simplest, immediate-read oracles are those that provide data that is only needed for an immediate decision, like \"What is the address for ethereumbook.info?\" or \"Is this person over 18?\" Those wishing to query this kind of data tend to do so on a \"just-in-time\" basis; the lookup is done when the information is needed and possibly never again. Examples of such oracles include those that hold data about or issued by organizations, such as academic certificates, dial codes, institutional memberships, airport identifiers, self-sovereign IDs, etc. This type of oracle stores data once in its contract storage, whence any other smart contract can look it up using a request call to the oracle contract. It may be updated. The data in the oracle’s storage is also available for direct lookup by blockchain-enabled (i.e., Ethereum client–connected) applications without having to go through the palaver and incurring the gas costs of issuing a transaction. A shop wanting to check the age of a customer wishing to purchase alcohol could use an oracle in this way. This type of oracle is attractive to an organization or company that might otherwise have to run and maintain servers to answer such data requests. Note that the data stored by the oracle is likely not to be the raw data that the oracle is serving, e.g., for efficiency or privacy reasons. A university might set up an oracle for the certificates of academic achievement of past students. However, storing the full details of the certificates (which could run to pages of courses taken and grades achieved) would be excessive. Instead, a hash of the certificate is sufficient. Likewise, a government might wish to put citizen IDs onto the Ethereum platform, where clearly the details included need to be kept private. Again, hashing the data (more carefully, in Merkle trees with salts) and only storing the root hash in the smart contract’s storage would be an efficient way to organize such a service.\n\n\nThe next setup is publish–subscribe, where an oracle that effectively provides a broadcast service for data that is expected to change (perhaps both regularly and frequently) is either polled by a smart contract on-chain, or watched by an off-chain daemon for updates. This category has a pattern similar to RSS feeds, WebSub, and the like, where the oracle is updated with new information and a flag signals that new data is available to those who consider themselves \"subscribed.\" Interested parties must either poll the oracle to check whether the latest information has changed, or listen for updates to oracle contracts and act when they occur. Examples include price feeds, weather information, economic or social statistics, traffic data, etc. Polling is very inefficient in the world of web servers, but not so in the peer-to-peer context of blockchain platforms: Ethereum clients have to keep up with all state changes, including changes to contract storage, so polling for data changes is a local call to a synced client. Ethereum event logs make it particularly easy for applications to look out for oracle updates, and so this pattern can in some ways even be considered a \"push\" service. However, if the polling is done from a smart contract, which might be necessary for some decentralized applications (e.g., where activation incentives are not possible), then significant gas expenditure may be incurred.\n\n\nThe request–response category is the most complicated: this is where the data space is too huge to be stored in a smart contract and users are expected to only need a small part of the overall dataset at a time. It is also an applicable model for data provider businesses. In practical terms, such an oracle might be implemented as a system of on-chain smart contracts and off-chain infrastructure used to monitor requests and retrieve and return data. A request for data from a decentralized application would typically be an asynchronous process involving a number of steps. In this pattern, firstly, an EOA transacts with a decentralized application, resulting in an interaction with a function defined in the oracle smart contract. This function initiates the request to the oracle, with the associated arguments detailing the data requested in addition to supplementary information that might include callback functions and scheduling parameters. Once this transaction has been validated, the oracle request can be observed as an EVM event emitted by the oracle contract, or as a state change; the arguments can be retrieved and used to perform the actual query of the off-chain data source. The oracle may also require payment for processing the request, gas payment for the callback, and permissions to access the requested data. Finally, the resulting data is signed by the oracle owner, attesting to the validity of the data at a given time, and delivered in a transaction to the decentralized application that made the request—either directly or via the oracle contract. Depending on the scheduling parameters, the oracle may broadcast further transactions updating the data at regular intervals (e.g., end-of-day pricing information).\n\n\nThe steps for a request–response oracle may be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nReceive a query from a DApp.\n\n\nParse the query.\n\n\nCheck that payment and data access permissions are provided.\n\n\nRetrieve relevant data from an off-chain source (and encrypt it if necessary).\n\n\nSign the transaction(s) with the data included.\n\n\nBroadcast the transaction(s) to the network.\n\n\nSchedule any further necessary transactions, such as notifications, etc.\n\n\n\n\nA range of other schemes are also possible; for example, data can be requested from and returned directly by an EOA, removing the need for an oracle smart contract. Similarly, the request and response could be made to and from an Internet of Things–enabled hardware sensor. Therefore, oracles can be human, software, or hardware.\n\n\nThe request–response pattern described here is commonly seen in client–server architectures. While this is a useful messaging pattern that allows applications to have a two-way conversation, it is perhaps inappropriate under certain conditions. For example, a smart bond requiring an interest rate from an oracle might have to request the data on a daily basis under a request–response pattern in order to ensure the rate is always correct. Given that interest rates change infrequently, a publish–subscribe pattern may be more appropriate here—especially when taking into consideration Ethereum’s limited bandwidth.\n\n\nPublish–subscribe is a pattern where publishers (in this context, oracles) do not send messages directly to receivers, but instead categorize published messages into distinct classes. Subscribers are able to express an interest in one or more classes and retrieve only those messages that are of interest. Under such a pattern, an oracle might write the interest rate to its own internal storage each time it changes. Multiple subscribed DApps can simply read it from the oracle contract, thereby reducing the impact on network bandwidth while minimizing storage costs.\n\n\nIn a broadcast or multicast pattern, an oracle would post all messages to a channel and subscribing contracts would listen to the channel under a variety of subscription modes. For example, an oracle might publish messages to a cryptocurrency exchange rate channel. A subscribing smart contract could request the full content of the channel if it required the time series for, e.g., a moving average calculation; another might require only the latest rate for a spot price calculation. A broadcast pattern is appropriate where the oracle does not need to know the identity of the subscribing contract.\n\n\n\nData Authentication\n\nIf we assume that the source of data being queried by a DApp is both authoritative and trustworthy (a not insignificant assumption), an outstanding question remains: given that the oracle and the request–response mechanism may be operated by distinct entities, how are we able trust this mechanism? There is a distinct possibility that data may be tampered with in transit, so it is critical that off-chain methods are able to attest to the returned data’s integrity. Two common approaches to data authentication are authenticity proofs and trusted execution environments (TEEs).\n\n\nAuthenticity proofs are cryptographic guarantees that data has not been tampered with. Based on a variety of attestation techniques (e.g., digitally signed proofs), they effectively shift the trust from the data carrier to the attestor (i.e., the provider of the attestation). By verifying the authenticity proof on-chain, smart contracts are able to verify the integrity of the data before operating upon it. Oraclize is an example of an oracle service leveraging a variety of authenticity proofs. One such proof that is currently available for data queries from the Ethereum main network is the TLSNotary proof. TLSNotary proofs allow a client to provide evidence to a third party that HTTPS web traffic occurred between the client and a server. While HTTPS is itself secure, it doesn’t support data signing. As a result, TLSNotary proofs rely on TLSNotary (via PageSigner) signatures. TLSNotary proofs leverage the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, enabling the TLS master key, which signs the data after it has been accessed, to be split between three parties: the server (the oracle), an auditee (Oraclize), and an auditor. Oraclize uses an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine instance as the auditor, which can be verified as having been unmodified since instantiation. This AWS instance stores the TLSNotary secret, allowing it to provide honesty proofs. Although it offers higher assurances against data tampering than a pure request–response mechanism, this approach does require the assumption that Amazon itself will not tamper with the VM instance.\n\n\nTown Crier is an authenticated data feed oracle system based on the TEE approach; such methods utilize hardware-based secure enclaves to ensure data integrity. Town Crier uses Intel’s  Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) to ensure that responses from HTTPS queries can be verified as authentic. SGX provides guarantees of integrity, ensuring that applications running within an enclave are protected by the CPU against tampering by any other process. It also provides confidentiality, ensuring that an application’s state is opaque to other processes when running within the enclave. And finally, SGX allows attestation, by generating a digitally signed proof that an application—securely identified by a hash of its build—is actually running within an enclave. By verifying this digital signature, it is possible for a decentralized application to prove that a Town Crier instance is running securely within an SGX enclave. This, in turn, proves that the instance has not been tampered with and that the data emitted by Town Crier is therefore authentic. The confidentiality property additionally enables Town Crier to handle private data by allowing data queries to be encrypted using the Town Crier instance’s public key. Operating an oracle’s query/response mechanism within an enclave such as SGX effectively allows us to think of it as running securely on trusted third-party hardware, ensuring that the requested data is returned untampered with (assuming that we trust Intel/SGX).\n\n\n\nComputation Oracles\n\nSo far, we have only discussed oracles in the context of requesting and delivering data. However, oracles can also be used to perform arbitrary computation, a function that can be especially useful given Ethereum’s inherent block gas limit and comparatively expensive computation costs. Rather than just relaying the results of a query, computation oracles can be used to perform computation on a set of inputs and return a calculated result that may have been infeasible to calculate on-chain. For example, one might use a computation oracle to perform a computationally intensive regression calculation in order to estimate the yield of a bond contract.\n\n\nIf you are willing to trust a centralized but auditable service, you can go again to Oraclize. They provide a service that allows decentralized applications to request the output of a computation performed in a sandboxed AWS virtual machine. The AWS instance creates an executable container from a user-configured Dockerfile packed in an archive that is uploaded to the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS; see [data_storage_sec]). On request, Oraclize retrieves this archive using its hash and then initializes and executes the Docker container on AWS, passing any arguments that are provided to the application as environment variables. The containerized application performs the calculation, subject to a time constraint, and writes the result to standard output, where it can be retrieved by Oraclize and returned to the decentralized application. Oraclize currently offers this service on an auditable t2.micro AWS instance, so if the computation is of some nontrivial value, it is possible to check that the correct Docker container was executed. Nonetheless, this is not a truly decentralized solution.\n\n\nThe concept of a 'cryptlet' as a standard for verifiable oracle truths has been formalized as part of Microsoft’s wider ESC Framework.  Cryptlets execute within an encrypted capsule that abstracts away the infrastructure, such as I/O, and has the CryptoDelegate attached so incoming and outgoing messages are signed, validated, and proven automatically.  Cryptlets support distributed transactions so that contract logic can take on complex multistep, multiblockchain, and external system transactions in an ACID manner.  This allows developers to create portable, isolated, and private resolutions of the truth for use in smart contracts. Cryptlets follow the format shown here:\n\n\n\npublic class SampleContractCryptlet : Cryptlet\n  {\n        public SampleContractCryptlet(Guid id, Guid bindingId, string name,\n            string address, IContainerServices hostContainer, bool contract)\n            : base(id, bindingId, name, address, hostContainer, contract)\n        {\n            MessageApi = new CryptletMessageApi(GetType().FullName,\n                new SampleContractConstructor())\n\n\n\nFor a more decentralized solution, we can turn to TrueBit, which offers a solution for scalable and verifiable off-chain computation. They use a system of solvers and verifiers who are incentivized to perform computations and verification of those computations, respectively. Should a solution be challenged, an iterative verification process on subsets of the computation is performed on-chain—a kind of 'verification game'. The game proceeds through a series of rounds, each recursively checking a smaller and smaller subset of the computation. The game eventually reaches a final round, where the challenge is sufficiently trivial such that the judges—Ethereum miners—can make a final ruling on whether the challenge was met, on-chain. In effect, TrueBit is an implementation of a computation market, allowing decentralized applications to pay for verifiable computation to be performed outside of the network, but relying on Ethereum to enforce the rules of the verification game. In theory, this enables trustless smart contracts to securely perform any computation task.\n\n\nA broad range of applications exist for systems like TrueBit, ranging from machine learning to verification of proof of work. An example of the latter is the Doge–Ethereum bridge, which uses TrueBit to verify Dogecoin’s proof of work (Scrypt), which is a memory-hard and computationally intensive function that cannot be computed within the Ethereum block gas limit. By performing this verification on TrueBit, it has been possible to securely verify Dogecoin transactions within a smart contract on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet.\n\n\n\nDecentralized Oracles\n\nWhile centralized data or computation oracles suffice for many applications, they represent single points of failure in the Ethereum network. A number of schemes have been proposed around the idea of decentralized oracles as a means of ensuring data availability and the creation of a network of individual data providers with an on-chain data aggregation system.\n\n\nChainLink has proposed a decentralized oracle network consisting of three key smart contracts—a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregation contract—and an off-chain registry of data providers. The reputation contract is used to keep track of data providers' performance. Scores in the reputation contract are used to populate the off-chain registry. The order-matching contract selects bids from oracles using the reputation contract. It then finalizes a service-level agreement, which includes query parameters and the number of oracles required. This means that the purchaser needn’t transact with the individual oracles directly. The aggregation contract collects responses (submitted using a commit–reveal scheme) from multiple oracles, calculates the final collective result of the query, and finally feeds the results back into the reputation contract.\n\n\nOne of the main challenges with such a decentralized approach is the formulation of the aggregation function. ChainLink proposes calculating a weighted response, allowing a validity score to be reported for each oracle response. Detecting an 'invalid' score here is nontrivial, since it relies on the premise that outlying data points, measured by deviations from responses provided by peers, are incorrect. Calculating a validity score based on the location of an oracle response among a distribution of responses risks penalizing correct answers over average ones. Therefore, ChainLink offers a standard set of aggregation contracts, but also allows customized aggregation contracts to be specified.\n\n\nA related idea is the SchellingCoin protocol. Here, multiple participants report values and the median is taken as the “correct” answer. Reporters are required to provide a deposit that is redistributed in favor of values that are closer to the median, therefore incentivizing the reporting of values that are similar to others. A common value, also known as the Schelling point, which respondents might consider as the natural and obvious target around which to coordinate is expected to be close to the actual value.\n\n\nJason Teutsch of TrueBit recently proposed a new design for a decentralized off-chain data availability oracle. This design leverages a dedicated proof-of-work blockchain that is able to correctly report on whether or not registered data is available during a given epoch. Miners attempt to download, store, and propagate all currently registered data, thereby guaranteeing data is available locally. While such a system is expensive in the sense that every mining node stores and propagates all registered data, the system allows storage to be reused by releasing data after the registration period ends.\n\n\n\nOracle Client Interfaces in Solidity\n\nUsing Oraclize to update the ETH/USD exchange rate from an external source is a Solidity example demonstrating how Oraclize can be used to continuously poll for the ETH/USD price from an API and store the result in a usable manner.\n\n\nExample 1. Using Oraclize to update the ETH/USD exchange rate from an external source\n\n\n\n/*\n   ETH/USD price ticker leveraging CryptoCompare API\n\n   This contract keeps in storage an updated ETH/USD price,\n   which is updated every 10 minutes.\n */\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.1;\nimport \"github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api/oraclizeAPI.sol\";\n\n/*\n   \"oraclize_\" prepended methods indicate inheritance from \"usingOraclize\"\n */\ncontract EthUsdPriceTicker is usingOraclize {\n\n    uint public ethUsd;\n\n    event newOraclizeQuery(string description);\n    event newCallbackResult(string result);\n\n    function EthUsdPriceTicker() payable {\n        // signals TLSN proof generation and storage on IPFS\n        oraclize_setProof(proofType_TLSNotary | proofStorage_IPFS);\n\n        // requests query\n        queryTicker();\n    }\n\n    function __callback(bytes32 _queryId, string _result, bytes _proof) public {\n        if (msg.sender != oraclize_cbAddress()) throw;\n        newCallbackResult(_result);\n\n        /*\n         * Parse the result string into an unsigned integer for on-chain use.\n         * Uses inherited \"parseInt\" helper from \"usingOraclize\", allowing for\n         * a string result such as \"123.45\" to be converted to uint 12345.\n         */\n        ethUsd = parseInt(_result, 2);\n\n        // called from callback since we're polling the price\n        queryTicker();\n    }\n\n    function queryTicker() public payable {\n        if (oraclize_getPrice(\"URL\") > this.balance) {\n            newOraclizeQuery(\"Oraclize query was NOT sent, please add some ETH\n                to cover for the query fee\");\n        } else {\n            newOraclizeQuery(\"Oraclize query was sent, standing by for the\n                answer...\");\n\n            // query params are (delay in seconds, datasource type,\n            // datasource argument)\n            // specifies JSONPath, to fetch specific portion of JSON API result\n            oraclize_query(60 * 10, \"URL\",\n                \"json(https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?\\\n                fsym=ETH&tsyms=USD,EUR,GBP).USD\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTo integrate with Oraclize, the contract EthUsdPriceTicker must be a child of usingOraclize; the usingOraclize contract is defined in the oraclizeAPI file. The data request is made using the oraclize_query function, which is inherited from the usingOraclize contract. This is an overloaded function that expects at least two arguments:\n\n\n\n\nThe supported data source to use, such as URL, WolframAlpha, IPFS, or computation\n\n\nThe argument for the given data source, which may include the use of JSON or XML parsing helpers\n\n\n\n\nThe price query is performed in the queryTicker function. In order to perform the query, Oraclize requires the payment of a small fee in ether, covering the gas cost for processing the result and transmitting it to the __callback function and an accompanying surcharge for the service. This amount is dependent on the data source and, where specified, the type of authenticity proof that is required. Once the data has been retrieved, the __callback function is called by an Oraclize-controlled account permissioned to do the callback; it passes in the response value and a unique queryId argument, which, for example, can be used to handle and track multiple pending callbacks from Oraclize.\n\n\nFinancial data provider Thomson Reuters also provides an oracle service for Ethereum, called BlockOne IQ, allowing market and reference data to be requested by smart contracts running on private or permissioned networks. Contract calling the BlockOne IQ service for market data shows the interface for the oracle, and a client contract that will make the request.\n\n\nExample 2. Contract calling the BlockOne IQ service for market data\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.11;\n\ncontract Oracle {\n    uint256 public divisor;\n    function initRequest(\n       uint256 queryType, function(uint256) external onSuccess,\n       function(uint256\n    ) external onFailure) public returns (uint256 id);\n    function addArgumentToRequestUint(uint256 id, bytes32 name, uint256 arg) public;\n    function addArgumentToRequestString(uint256 id, bytes32 name, bytes32 arg)\n        public;\n    function executeRequest(uint256 id) public;\n    function getResponseUint(uint256 id, bytes32 name) public constant\n        returns(uint256);\n    function getResponseString(uint256 id, bytes32 name) public constant\n        returns(bytes32);\n    function getResponseError(uint256 id) public constant returns(bytes32);\n    function deleteResponse(uint256 id) public constant;\n}\n\ncontract OracleB1IQClient {\n\n    Oracle private oracle;\n    event LogError(bytes32 description);\n\n    function OracleB1IQClient(address addr) public payable {\n        oracle = Oracle(addr);\n        getIntraday(\"IBM\", now);\n    }\n\n    function getIntraday(bytes32 ric, uint256 timestamp) public {\n        uint256 id = oracle.initRequest(0, this.handleSuccess, this.handleFailure);\n        oracle.addArgumentToRequestString(id, \"symbol\", ric);\n        oracle.addArgumentToRequestUint(id, \"timestamp\", timestamp);\n        oracle.executeRequest(id);\n    }\n\n    function handleSuccess(uint256 id) public {\n        assert(msg.sender == address(oracle));\n        bytes32 ric = oracle.getResponseString(id, \"symbol\");\n        uint256 open = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"open\");\n        uint256 high = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"high\");\n        uint256 low = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"low\");\n        uint256 close = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"close\");\n        uint256 bid = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"bid\");\n        uint256 ask = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"ask\");\n        uint256 timestamp = oracle.getResponseUint(id, \"timestamp\");\n        oracle.deleteResponse(id);\n        // Do something with the price data\n    }\n\n    function handleFailure(uint256 id) public {\n        assert(msg.sender == address(oracle));\n        bytes32 error = oracle.getResponseError(id);\n        oracle.deleteResponse(id);\n        emit LogError(error);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data request is initiated using the initRequest function, which allows the query type (in this example, a request for an intraday price) to be specified, in addition to two callback functions.\nThis returns a uint256 identifier that can then be used to provide additional arguments. The addArgumentToRequestString function is used to specify the Reuters Instrument Code (RIC), here for IBM stock, and addArgumentToRequestUint allows the timestamp to be specified. Now, passing in an alias for block.timestamp will retrieve the current price for IBM. The request is then executed by the executeRequest function. Once the request has been processed, the oracle contract will call the onSuccess callback function with the query identifier, allowing the resulting data to be retrieved; in the event of retrieval failure, the onFailure callback will return an error code instead. The available fields that can be retrieved on success include open, high, low, close (OHLC), and bid/ask prices.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nAs you can see, oracles provide a crucial service to smart contracts: they bring external facts to contract execution. With that, of course, oracles also introduce a significant risk—if they are trusted sources and can be compromised, they can result in compromised execution of the smart contracts they feed.\n\n\nGenerally, when considering the use of an oracle be very careful about the trust model. If you assume the oracle can be trusted, you may be undermining the security of your smart contract by exposing it to potentially false inputs. That said, oracles can be very useful if the security assumptions are carefully considered.\n\n\nDecentralized oracles can resolve some of these concerns and offer Ethereum smart contracts trustless external data. Choose carefully and you can start exploring the bridge between Ethereum and the \"real world\" that oracles offer.\n\n\n\n"},"12dapps.html":{"url":"12dapps.html","title":"Chapter 12: Decentralized Applications (DApps)","keywords":"","body":"\nDecentralized Applications (DApps)\n\n\nIn this chapter we will explore the world of decentralized applications, or DApps. From the early days of Ethereum, the founders' vision was much broader than \"smart contracts\": no less than reinventing the web and creating a new world of DApps, aptly called web3. Smart contracts are a way to decentralize the controlling logic and payment functions of applications. Web3 DApps are about decentralizing all other aspects of an application: storage, messaging, naming, etc. (see Web3: A decentralized web using smart contracts and P2P technologies).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Web3: A decentralized web using smart contracts and P2P technologies\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile \"decentralized apps\" are an audacious vision of the future, the term \"DApp\" is often applied to any smart contract with a web frontend. Some of these so-called DApps are highly centralized applications (CApps?). Beware of false DApps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this chapter we will develop and deploy a sample DApp: an auction platform. You can find the source code in the book’s repository under code/auction_dapp. We will look at each aspect of an auction application and see how we can decentralize the application as much as possible. First, though, let’s take a closer look at the defining characteristics and advantages of DApps.\n\n\nWhat Is a DApp?\n\nA DApp is an application that is mostly or entirely decentralized.\n\n\nConsider all the possible aspects of an application that may be decentralized:\n\n\n\n\nBackend software (application logic)\n\n\nFrontend software\n\n\nData storage\n\n\nMessage communications\n\n\nName resolution\n\n\n\n\nEach of these can be somewhat centralized or somewhat decentralized. For example, a frontend can be developed as a web app that runs on a centralized server, or as a mobile app that runs on your device. The backend and storage can be on private servers and proprietary databases, or you can use a smart contract and P2P storage.\n\n\nThere are many advantages to creating a DApp that a typical centralized architecture cannot provide:\n\n\n\nResiliency\n\nBecause the business logic is controlled by a smart contract, a DApp backend will be fully distributed and managed on a blockchain platform. Unlike an application deployed on a centralized server, a DApp will have no downtime and will continue to be available as long as the platform is still operating.\n\nTransparency\n\nThe on-chain nature of a DApp allows everyone to inspect the code and be more sure about its function. Any interaction with the DApp will be stored forever in the blockchain.\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nAs long as a user has access to an Ethereum node (running one if necessary), the user will always be able to interact with a DApp without interference from any centralized control. No service provider, or even the owner of the smart contract, can alter the code once it is deployed on the network.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem as it stands today, there are very few truly decentralized apps—most still rely on centralized services and servers for some part of their operation. In the future, we expect that it will be possible for every part of any DApp to be operated in a fully decentralized way.\n\n\nBackend (Smart Contract)\n\nIn a DApp, smart contracts are used to store the business logic (program code) and the related state of your application. You can think of a smart contract replacing a server-side (aka \"backend\") component in a regular application. This is an oversimplification, of course. One of the main differences is that any computation executed in a smart contract is very expensive and so should be kept as minimal as possible. It is therefore important to identify which aspects of the application need a trusted and decentralized execution platform.\n\n\nEthereum smart contracts allow you to build architectures in which a network of smart contracts call and pass data between each other, reading and writing their own state variables as they go, with their complexity restricted only by the block gas limit. After you deploy your smart contract, your business logic could well be used by many other developers in the future.\n\n\nOne major consideration of smart contract architecture design is the inability to change the code of a smart contract once it is deployed. It can be deleted if it is programmed with an accessible SELFDESTRUCT opcode, but other than complete removal, the code cannot be changed in any way.\n\n\nThe second major consideration of smart contract architecture design is DApp size. A really large monolithic smart contract may cost a lot of gas to deploy and use. Therefore, some applications may choose to have off-chain computation and an external data source. Keep in mind, however, that having the core business logic of the DApp be dependent on external data (e.g., from a centralized server) means your users will have to trust these external resources.\n\n\n\nFrontend (Web User Interface)\n\nUnlike the business logic of the DApp, which requires a developer to understand the EVM and new languages such as Solidity, the client-side interface of a DApp can use standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). This allows a traditional web developer to use familiar tools, libraries, and frameworks. Interactions with Ethereum, such as signing messages, sending transactions, and managing keys, are often conducted through the web browser, via an extension such as MetaMask (see [intro_chapter]).\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to create a mobile DApp as well, currently there are few resources to help create mobile DApp frontends, mainly due to the lack of mobile clients that can serve as a light client with key-management functionality.\n\n\nThe frontend is usually linked to Ethereum via the web3.js JavaScript library, which is bundled with the frontend resources and served to a browser by a web server.\n\n\n\nData Storage\n\nDue to high gas costs and the currently low block gas limit, smart contracts are not well suited to storing or processing large amounts of data. Hence, most DApps utilize off-chain data storage services, meaning they store the bulky data off the Ethereum chain, on a data storage platform. That data storage platform can be centralized (for example, a typical cloud database), or the data can be decentralized, stored on a P2P platform such as the IPFS, or Ethereum’s own Swarm platform.\n\n\nDecentralized P2P storage is ideal for storing and distributing large static assets such as images, videos, and the resources of the application’s frontend web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). We’ll look at a few of the options next.\n\n\nIPFS\n\nThe Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized content-addressable storage system that distributes stored objects among peers in a P2P network. \"Content addressable\" means that each piece of content (file) is hashed and the hash is used to identify that file. You can then retrieve any file from any IPFS node by requesting it by its hash.\n\n\nIPFS aims to replace HTTP as the protocol of choice for delivery of web applications. Instead of storing a web application on a single server, the files are stored on IPFS and can be retrieved from any IPFS node.\n\n\nMore information about IPFS can be found at https://ipfs.io.\n\n\n\nSwarm\n\nSwarm is another content-addressable P2P storage system, similar to IPFS. Swarm was created by the Ethereum Foundation, as part of the Go-Ethereum suite of tools. Like IPFS, it allows you to store files that get disseminated and replicated by Swarm nodes. You can access any Swarm file by referring to it by a hash. Swarm allows you to access a website from a decentralized P2P system, instead of a central web server.\n\n\nThe home page for Swarm is itself stored on Swarm and accessible on your Swarm node or a gateway:\nhttps://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized Message Communications Protocols\n\nAnother major component of any application is inter-process communication. That means being able to exchange messages between applications, between different instances of the application, or between users of the application. Traditionally, this is achieved by reliance on a centralized server. However, there are a variety of decentralized alternatives to server-based protocols, offering messaging over a P2P network. The most notable P2P messaging protocol for DApps is Whisper, which is part of the Ethereum Foundation’s Go-Ethereum suite of tools.\n\n\nThe final aspect of an application that can be decentralized is name resolution. We’ll take a close look at Ethereum’s name service later in this chapter; now, though, let’s dig into an example.\n\n\n\n\nA Basic DApp Example: Auction DApp\n\nIn this section we will start building an example DApp, to explore the various decentralization tools. Our DApp will implement a decentralized auction.\n\n\nThe Auction DApp allows a user to register a \"deed\" token, which represents some unique asset, such as a house, a car, a trademark, etc. Once a token has been registered, the ownership of the token is transferred to the Auction DApp, allowing it to be listed for sale. The Auction DApp lists each of the registered tokens, allowing other users to place bids. During each auction, users can join a chat room created specifically for that auction. Once an auction is finalized, the deed token ownership is transferred to the winner of the auction.\n\n\nThe overall auction process can be seen in Auction DApp: A simple example auction DApp.\n\n\nThe main components of our Auction DApp are:\n\n\n\n\nA smart contract implementing ERC721 non-fungible \"deed\" tokens (DeedRepository)\n\n\nA smart contract implementing an auction (AuctionRepository) to sell the deeds\n\n\nA web frontend using the Vue/Vuetify JavaScript framework\n\n\nThe web3.js library to connect to Ethereum chains (via MetaMask or other clients)\n\n\nA Swarm client, to store resources such as images\n\n\nA Whisper client, to create per-auction chat rooms for all participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Auction DApp: A simple example auction DApp\n\n\nYou can find the source code for the auction DApp in the book’s repository.\n\n\nAuction DApp: Backend Smart Contracts\n\nOur Auction DApp example is supported by two smart contracts that we need to deploy on an Ethereum blockchain in order to support the application: AuctionRepository and DeedRepository.\n\n\nLet’s start by looking at DeedRepository, shown in DeedRepository.sol: An ERC721 deed token for use in an auction. This contract is an ERC721-compatible non-fungible token (see [erc721]).\n\n\nExample 1. DeedRepository.sol: An ERC721 deed token for use in an auction\n\n\n\nlink:code/auction_dapp/backend/contracts/DeedRepository.sol[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the DeedRepository contract is a straightforward implementation of an ERC721-compatible token.\n\n\nOur Auction DApp uses the DeedRepository contract to issue and track tokens for each auction. The auction itself is orchestrated by the AuctionRepository contract. This contract is too long to include here in full, but AuctionRepository.sol: The main Auction DApp smart contract shows the main definition of the contract and data structures. The entire contract is available in the book’s GitHub repository.\n\n\nExample 2. AuctionRepository.sol: The main Auction DApp smart contract\n\n\n\ncontract AuctionRepository {\n\n    // Array with all auctions\n    Auction[] public auctions;\n\n    // Mapping from auction index to user bids\n    mapping(uint256 => Bid[]) public auctionBids;\n\n    // Mapping from owner to a list of owned auctions\n    mapping(address => uint[]) public auctionOwner;\n\n    // Bid struct to hold bidder and amount\n    struct Bid {\n        address from;\n        uint256 amount;\n    }\n\n    // Auction struct which holds all the required info\n    struct Auction {\n        string name;\n        uint256 blockDeadline;\n        uint256 startPrice;\n        string metadata;\n        uint256 deedId;\n        address deedRepositoryAddress;\n        address owner;\n        bool active;\n        bool finalized;\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AuctionRepository contract manages all auctions with the following functions:\n\n\n\ngetCount()\ngetBidsCount(uint _auctionId)\ngetAuctionsOf(address _owner)\ngetCurrentBid(uint _auctionId)\ngetAuctionsCountOfOwner(address _owner)\ngetAuctionById(uint _auctionId)\ncreateAuction(address _deedRepositoryAddress, uint256 _deedId,\n              string _auctionTitle, string _metadata, uint256 _startPrice,\n              uint _blockDeadline)\napproveAndTransfer(address _from, address _to, address _deedRepositoryAddress,\n                   uint256 _deedId)\ncancelAuction(uint _auctionId)\nfinalizeAuction(uint _auctionId)\nbidOnAuction(uint _auctionId)\n\n\n\nYou can deploy these contracts to the Ethereum blockchain of your choice (e.g., Ropsten) using truffle in the book’s repository:\n\n\n$ cd code/auction_dapp/backend\n$ truffle init\n$ truffle compile\n$ truffle migrate --network ropsten\n\n\nDApp governance\n\nIf you read through the two smart contracts of the Auction DApp you will notice something important: there is no special account or role that has special privileges over the DApp. Each auction has an owner with some special capabilities, but the Auction DApp itself has no privileged user.\n\n\nThis is a deliberate choice to decentralize the governance of the DApp and relinquish any control once it has been deployed. Some DApps, by comparison, have one or more privileged accounts with special capabilities, such as the ability to terminate the DApp contract, to override or change its configuration, or to \"veto\" certain operations. Usually, these governance functions are introduced in the DApp in order to avoid unknown problems that might arise due to a bug.\n\n\nThe issue of governance is a particularly difficult one to solve, as it represents a double-edged sword. On the one side, privileged accounts are dangerous; if compromised, they can subvert the security of the DApp. On the other side, without any privileged account, there are no recovery options if a bug is found. We have seen both of these risks manifest in Ethereum DApps. In the case of The DAO ([real_world_example_the_dao] and [ethereum_fork_history]), there were some privileged accounts called the \"curators,\" but they were very limited in their capabilities. Those accounts were not able to override the DAO attacker’s withdrawal of the funds. In a more recent case, the decentralized exchange Bancor experienced a massive theft because a privileged management account was compromised. Turns out, Bancor was not as decentralized as initially assumed.\n\n\nWhen building a DApp, you have to decide if you want to make the smart contracts truly independent, launching them and then having no control, or create privileged accounts and run the risk of those being compromised. Either choice carries risk, but in the long run, true DApps cannot have specialized access for privileged accounts—that’s not decentralized.\n\n\n\n\nAuction DApp: Frontend User Interface\n\nOnce the Auction DApp’s contracts are deployed, you can interact with them using your favorite JavaScript console and web3.js, or another web3 library. However, most users will need an easy-to-use interface. Our Auction DApp user interface is built using the Vue2/Vuetify JavaScript framework from Google.\n\n\nYou can find the user interface code in the code/auction_dapp/frontend folder in the book’s repository. The directory has the following structure and contents:\n\n\n\nfrontend/\n|-- build\n|   |-- build.js\n|   |-- check-versions.js\n|   |-- logo.png\n|   |-- utils.js\n|   |-- vue-loader.conf.js\n|   |-- webpack.base.conf.js\n|   |-- webpack.dev.conf.js\n|   `-- webpack.prod.conf.js\n|-- config\n|   |-- dev.env.js\n|   |-- index.js\n|   `-- prod.env.js\n|-- index.html\n|-- package.json\n|-- package-lock.json\n|-- README.md\n|-- src\n|   |-- App.vue\n|   |-- components\n|   |   |-- Auction.vue\n|   |   `-- Home.vue\n|   |-- config.js\n|   |-- contracts\n|   |   |-- AuctionRepository.json\n|   |   `-- DeedRepository.json\n|   |-- main.js\n|   |-- models\n|   |   |-- AuctionRepository.js\n|   |   |-- ChatRoom.js\n|   |   `-- DeedRepository.js\n|   `-- router\n|       `-- index.js\n\n\n\nOnce you have deployed the contracts, edit the frontend configuration in frontend/src/config.js and enter the addresses of the DeedRepository and AuctionRepository contracts, as deployed. The frontend application also needs access to an Ethereum node offering a JSON-RPC and WebSockets interface. Once you’ve configured the frontend, launch it with a web server on your local machine:\n\n\n$ npm install\n$ npm run dev\n\n\nThe Auction DApp frontend will launch and will be accessible via any web browser at http://localhost:8080.\n\n\nIf all goes well you should see the screen shown in Auction DApp user interface, which illustrates the Auction DApp running in a web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Auction DApp user interface\n\n\n\n\nFurther Decentralizing the Auction DApp\n\nOur DApp is already quite decentralized, but we can improve things.\n\n\nThe AuctionRepository contract operates independently of any oversight, open to anyone. Once deployed it cannot be stopped, nor can any auction be controlled. Each auction has a separate chat room that allows anyone to communicate about the auction without censorship or identification. The various auction assets, such as the description and associated image, are stored on Swarm, making them hard to censor or block.\n\n\nAnyone can interact with the DApp by constructing transactions manually or by running the Vue frontend on their local machine. The DApp code itself is open source and developed collaboratively on a public repository.\n\n\nThere are two things we can do to make this DApp decentralized and resilient:\n\n\n\n\nStore all the application code on Swarm or IPFS.\n\n\nAccess the DApp by reference to a name, using the Ethereum Name Service.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll explore the first option in the next section, and we’ll dig into the second in The Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\n\n\nStoring the Auction DApp on Swarm\n\nWe introduced Swarm in Swarm, earlier in this chapter. Our Auction DApp already uses Swarm to store the icon image for each auction. This is a much more efficient solution than attempting to store data on Ethereum, which is expensive. It is also a lot more resilient than if these images were stored in a centralized service like a web server or file server.\n\n\nBut we can take things one step further. We can store the entire frontend of the DApp itself in Swarm and run it from a Swarm node directly, instead of running a web server.\n\n\nPreparing Swarm\n\nTo get started, you need to install Swarm and initialize your Swarm node. Swarm is part of the Ethereum Foundation’s Go-Ethereum suite of tools. Refer to the instructions for installing Go-Ethereum in [go_ethereum_geth], or to install a Swarm binary release, follow the instructions in the Swarm documentation.\n\n\nOnce you have installed Swarm, you can check that it is working correctly by running it with the version command:\n\n\n$ swarm version\nVersion: 0.3\nGit Commit: 37685930d953bcbe023f9bc65b135a8d8b8f1488\nGo Version: go1.10.1\nOS: linux\n\n\nTo start running Swarm, you must tell it how to connect to an instance of Geth, to access the JSON-RPC API. Get it started by following the instructions in the Getting Started guide.\n\n\nWhen you start Swarm, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\nMaximum peer count                       ETH=25 LES=0 total=25\nStarting peer-to-peer node               instance=swarm/v0.3.1-225171a4/linux...\nconnecting to ENS API                    url=http://127.0.0.1:8545\nswarm[5955]: [189B blob data]\nStarting P2P networking\nUDP listener up                          self=enode://f50c8e19ff841bcd5ce7d2d...\nUpdated bzz local addr                   oaddr=9c40be8b83e648d50f40ad3... uaddr=e\nStarting Swarm service\n9c40be8b hive starting\ndetected an existing store. trying to load peers\nhive 9c40be8b: peers loaded\nSwarm network started on bzz address: 9c40be8b83e648d50f40ad3d35f...\nPss started\nStreamer started\nIPC endpoint opened                      url=/home/ubuntu/.ethereum/bzzd.ipc\nRLPx listener up                         self=enode://f50c8e19ff841bcd5ce7d2d...\n\n\n\nYou can confirm that your Swarm node is running correctly by connecting to the local Swarm gateway web interface:\nhttp://localhost:8500.\n\n\nYou should see a screen like the one in Swarm gateway on localhost and be able to query any Swarm hash or ENS name.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Swarm gateway on localhost\n\n\n\nUploading Files to Swarm\n\nOnce you have your local Swarm node and gateway running, you can upload to Swarm and the files will be accessible on any Swarm node, simply by reference to the file hash.\n\n\nLet’s test this by uploading a file:\n\n\n$ swarm up code/auction_dapp/README.md\nec13042c83ffc2fb5cb0aa8c53f770d36c9b3b35d0468a0c0a77c97016bb8d7c\n\n\nSwarm has uploaded the README.md file and returned a hash that you can use to access the file from any Swarm node. For example, you could use the public Swarm gateway.\n\n\nWhile uploading one file is relatively straightforward, it is a bit more complex to upload an entire DApp frontend. That’s because the various DApp resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, libraries, etc.) have embedded references to each other. Normally, a web server translates URLs to local files and serves the correct resources. We can achieve the same for Swarm by packaging our DApp.\n\n\nIn the Auction DApp, there’s a script for packaging all the resources:\n\n\n$ cd code/auction_dapp/frontend\n$ npm run build\n\n> frontend@1.0.0 build /home/aantonop/Dev/ethereumbook/code/auction_dapp/frontend\n> node build/build.js\n\nHash: 9ee134d8db3c44dd574d\nVersion: webpack 3.10.0\nTime: 25665ms\nAsset     Size\nstatic/js/vendor.77913f316aaf102cec11.js  1.25 MB\nstatic/js/app.5396ead17892922422d4.js   502 kB\nstatic/js/manifest.87447dd4f5e60a5f9652.js  1.54 kB\nstatic/css/app.0e50d6a1d2b1ed4daa03d306ced779cc.css  1.13 kB\nstatic/css/app.0e50d6a1d2b1ed4daa03d306ced779cc.css.map  2.54 kB\nstatic/js/vendor.77913f316aaf102cec11.js.map  4.74 MB\nstatic/js/app.5396ead17892922422d4.js.map   893 kB\nstatic/js/manifest.87447dd4f5e60a5f9652.js.map  7.86 kB\nindex.html  1.15 kB\n\nBuild complete.\n\n\nThe result of this command will be a new directory, code/auction_dapp/frontend/dist, that contains the entire Auction DApp frontend, packed together:\n\n\n\ndist/\n|-- index.html\n`-- static\n    |-- css\n    |   |-- app.0e50d6a1d2b1ed4daa03d306ced779cc.css\n    |   `-- app.0e50d6a1d2b1ed4daa03d306ced779cc.css.map\n    `-- js\n        |-- app.5396ead17892922422d4.js\n        |-- app.5396ead17892922422d4.js.map\n        |-- manifest.87447dd4f5e60a5f9652.js\n        |-- manifest.87447dd4f5e60a5f9652.js.map\n        |-- vendor.77913f316aaf102cec11.js\n        `-- vendor.77913f316aaf102cec11.js.map\n\n\n\nNow you can upload the entire DApp to Swarm, by using the up command and the --recursive option. Here, we also tell Swarm that index.html is the defaultpath for loading this DApp:\n\n\n$ swarm --bzzapi http://localhost:8500 --recursive \\\n  --defaultpath dist/index.html up dist/\n\nab164cf37dc10647e43a233486cdeffa8334b026e32a480dd9cbd020c12d4581\n\n\nNow, our entire Auction DApp is hosted on Swarm and accessible by the Swarm URL:\n\n\nbzz://ab164cf37dc10647e43a233486cdeffa8334b026e32a480dd9cbd020c12d4581\n\n\nWe’ve made some progress in decentralizing our DApp, but we’ve made it harder to use. A URL like that is much less user-friendly than a nice name like auction_dapp.com. Are we forced to sacrifice usability in order to gain decentralization? Not necessarily. In the next section we will examine Ethereum’s name service, which allows us to use easy-to-read names but still preserves the decentralized nature of our application.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nYou can design the best smart contract in the world, but if you don’t provide a good interface for users, they won’t be able to access it.\n\n\nOn the traditional internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) allows us to use human-readable names in the browser while resolving those names to IP addresses or other identifiers behind the scenes. On the Ethereum blockchain, the Ethereum Naming System (ENS) solves the same problem, but in a decentralized manner.\n\n\nFor example, the Ethereum Foundation donation address is 0xfB6916095ca1df60&thinsp;bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359; in a wallet that supports ENS, it’s simply ethereum.eth.\n\n\nENS is more than a smart contract; it’s a fundamental DApp itself, offering a decentralized name service. Furthermore, ENS is supported by a number of DApps for registration, management, and auctions of registered names. ENS demonstrates how DApps can work together: it’s DApp built to serve other DApps, supported by an ecosystem of DApps, embedded in other DApps, and so on.\n\n\nIn this section we will look at how ENS works. We’ll demonstrate how you can set up your own name and link it to a wallet or Ethereum address, how you can embed ENS in another DApp, and how you can use ENS to name your DApp resources to make them easier to use.\n\n\nHistory of Ethereum Name Services\n\nName registration was the first noncurrency application of blockchains, pioneered by Namecoin. The Ethereum White Paper gave a two-line Namecoin-like registration system as one of its example applications.\n\n\nEarly releases of Geth and the C++ Ethereum client had a built-in namereg contract (not used any more), and many proposals and ERCs for name services were made, but it was only when Nick Johnson started working for the Ethereum Foundation in 2016 and took the project under his wing that serious work on a registrar started.\n\n\nENS was launched on Star Wars Day, May 4, 2017 (after a failed attempt to launch it on Pi Day, March 15).\n\n\n\nThe ENS Specification\n\nENS is specified mainly in three Ethereum Improvement Proposals: EIP-137, which specifies the basic functions of ENS; EIP-162, which describes the auction system for the .eth root; and EIP-181, which specifies reverse registration of addresses.\n\n\nENS follows a \"sandwich\" design philosophy: a very simple layer on the bottom, followed by layers of more complex but replaceable code, with a very simple top layer that keeps all the funds in separate accounts.\n\n\n\nBottom Layer: Name Owners and Resolvers\n\nThe ENS operates on \"nodes\" instead of human-readable names: a human-readable name is converted to a node using the \"Namehash\" algorithm.\n\n\nThe base layer of ENS is a cleverly simple contract (less than 50 lines of code) defined by ERC137 that allows only nodes' owners to set information about their names and to create subnodes (the ENS equivalent of DNS subdomains).\n\n\nThe only functions on the base layer are those that enable a node owner to set information about their own node (specifically the resolver, time to live, or transferring the ownership) and to create owners of new subnodes.\n\n\nThe Namehash algorithm\n\nNamehash is a recursive algorithm that can convert any name into a hash that identifies the name.\n\n\n\"Recursive\" means that we solve the problem by solving a subproblem that is a smaller problem of the same type, and then use the solution to the subproblem to solve the original problem.\n\n\nNamehash recursively hashes components of the name, producing a unique, fixed-length string (or “node”) for any valid input domain. For example, the Namehash node of subdomain.example.eth is keccak('' node) + keccak(''). The subproblem we must solve is to compute the node for example.eth, which is keccak('' node) + keccak('').  To begin, we must compute the node for eth, which is keccak() + keccak('').\n\n\nThe root node is what we call the \"base case\" of our recursion, and we obviously can’t define it recursively, or the algorithm will never terminate! The root node is defined as 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (32 zero bytes).\n\n\nPutting this all together, the node of subdomain.example.eth is therefore keccak(keccak(keccak(0x0...0 + keccak('eth')) + keccak('example')) + keccak('subdomain')).\n\n\nGeneralizing, we can define the Namehash function as follows (the base case for the root node, or empty name, followed by the recursive step):\n\n\n\nnamehash([]) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nnamehash([label, ...]) = keccak256(namehash(...) + keccak256(label))\n\n\n\nIn Python this becomes:\n\n\n\ndef namehash(name):\n  if name == '':\n    return '\\0' * 32\n  else:\n    label, _, remainder = name.partition('.')\n    return sha3(namehash(remainder) + sha3(label))\n\n\n\nThus, mastering-ethereum.eth will be processed as follows:\n\n\n\nnamehash('mastering-ethereum.eth')\n⇒ sha3(namehash('eth') + sha3('mastering-ethereum'))\n⇒ sha3(sha3(namehash('') + sha3('eth')) + sha3('mastering-ethereum'))\n⇒ sha3(sha3(('\\0' * 32) + sha3('eth')) + sha3('mastering-ethereum'))\n\n\n\nOf course, subdomains can themselves have subdomains: there could be a sub.subdomain.example.eth after subdomain.example.eth, then a sub.sub.subdomain.example.eth, and so on. To avoid expensive recomputation, since Namehash depends only on the name itself, the node for a given name can be precomputed and inserted into a contract, removing the need for string manipulation and permitting immediate lookup of ENS records regardless of the number of components in the raw name.\n\n\n\nHow to choose a valid name\n\nNames consist of a series of dot-separated labels. Although upper- and lowercase letters are allowed, all labels should follow a UTS #46 normalization process that case-folds labels before hashing them, so names with different case but identical spelling will end up with the same Namehash.\n\n\nYou could use labels and domains of any length, but for the sake of compatibility with legacy DNS, the following rules are recommended:\n\n\n\n\nLabels should be no more than 64 characters each.\n\n\nComplete ENS names should be no more than 255 characters.\n\n\nLabels should not start or end with hyphens, or start with digits.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot node ownership\n\nOne of the results of this hierarchical system is that it relies on the owners of the root node, who are able to create top-level domains (TLDs).\n\n\nWhile the eventual goal is to adopt a decentralized decision-making process for new TLDs, at the time of writing the root node is controlled by a 4-of-7 multisig, held by people in different countries (built as a reflection of the 7 keyholders of the DNS system).\nAs a result, a majority of at least 4 of the 7 keyholders is required to effect any change.\n\n\nCurrently the purpose and goal of these keyholders is to work in consensus with the community to:\n\n\n\n\nMigrate and upgrade the temporary ownership of the .eth TLD to a more permanent contract once the system is evaluated.\n\n\nAllow adding new TLDs, if the community agrees they are needed.\n\n\nMigrate the ownership of the root multisig to a more decentralized contract, when such a system is agreed upon, tested, and implemented.\n\n\nServe as a last-resort way to deal with any bugs or vulnerabilities in the top-level registries.\n\n\n\n\n\nResolvers\n\nThe basic ENS contract can’t add metadata to names; that is the job of so-called \"resolver contracts.\" These are user-created contracts that can answer questions about the name, such as what Swarm address is associated with the app, what address receives payments to the app (in ether or tokens), or what the hash of the app is (to verify its integrity).\n\n\n\n\nMiddle Layer: The .eth Nodes\n\nAt the time of writing, the only top-level domain that is uniquely registrable in a smart contract is .eth.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere’s work underway on enabling traditional DNS domain owners to claim ENS ownership.\nWhile in theory this could work for .com, the only domain that this has been implemented for so far is .xyz, and only on the Ropsten testnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.eth domains are distributed via an auction system. There is no reserved list or priority, and the only way to acquire a name is to use the system. The auction system is a complex piece of code (over 500 lines); most of the early development efforts (and bugs!) in ENS were in this part of the system. However, it’s also replaceable and upgradeable, without risk to the funds—more on that later.\n\n\nVickrey auctions\n\nNames are distributed via a modified Vickrey auction. In a traditional Vickrey auction, every bidder submits a sealed bid, and all of them are revealed simultaneously, at which point the highest bidder wins the auction but only pays the second-highest bid. Therefore bidders are incentivized not to bid less than the true value of the name to them, since bidding their true value increases the chance they will win but does not affect the price they will eventually pay.\n\n\nOn a blockchain, some changes are required:\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure bidders don’t submit bids they have no intention of paying, they must lock up a value equal to or higher than their bid beforehand, to guarantee the bid is valid.\n\n\nBecause you can’t hide secrets on a blockchain, bidders must execute at least two transactions (a commit–reveal process), in order to hide the original value and name they bid on.\n\n\nSince you can’t reveal all bids simultaneously in a decentralized system, bidders must reveal their own bids themselves; if they don’t, they forfeit their locked-up funds. Without this forfeit, one could make many bids and choose to reveal only one or two, turning a sealed-bid auction into a traditional increasing price auction.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the auction is a four-step process:\n\n\n\n\nStart the auction. This is required to broadcast the intent to register a name.\nThis creates all auction deadlines. The names are hashed, so that only those who have the name in their dictionary will know which auction was opened. This allows some privacy, which is useful if you are creating a new project and don’t want to share details about it.\nYou can open multiple dummy auctions at the same time, so if someone is following you they cannot simply bid on all auctions you open.\n\n\nMake a sealed bid. You must do this before the bidding deadline, by tying a given amount of ether to the hash of a secret message (containing, among other things, the hash of the name, the actual amount of the bid, and a salt).\nYou can lock up more ether than you are actually bidding in order to mask your true valuation.\n\n\nReveal the bid. During the reveal period, you must make a transaction that reveals the bid, which will then calculate the highest bid and the second-highest bid and send ether back to unsuccessful bidders.\nEvery time the bid is revealed the current winner is recalculated; therefore, the last one to be set before the revealing deadline expires becomes the overall winner.\n\n\nClean up after. If you are the winner, you can finalize the auction in order to get back the difference between your bid and the second-highest bid.\nIf you forgot to reveal you can make a late reveal and recover a little of your bid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Layer: The Deeds\n\nThe top layer of ENS is yet another super-simple contract with a single purpose: to hold the funds.\n\n\nWhen you win a name, the funds are not actually sent anywhere, but are just locked up for the period you want to hold the name (at least a year).\nThis works like a guaranteed buyback: if the owner does not want the name any more they can sell it back to the system and recover their ether (so the cost of holding the name is the opportunity cost of doing something with a return greater than zero).\n\n\nOf course, having a single contract hold millions of dollars in ether has proven to be very risky, so instead ENS creates a deed contract for each new name.\nThe deed contract is very simple (about 50 lines of code), and it only allows the funds to be transferred back to a single account (the deed owner) and to be called by a single entity (the registrar contract).\nThis approach drastically reduces the attack surface where bugs can put the funds at risk.\n\n\n\nRegistering a Name\n\nRegistering a name in ENS is a four-step process, as we saw in  Vickrey auctions. First we place a bid for any available name, then we reveal our bid after 48 hours to secure the name. ENS timeline for registration is a diagram showing the timeline of registration.\n\n\nLet’s register our first name!\n\n\nWe will use one of several available user-friendly interfaces to search for available names, place a bid on the name ethereumbook.eth, reveal the bid, and secure the name.\n\n\nThere are a number of web-based interfaces to ENS that allow us to interact with the ENS DApp. For this example, we will use the MyCrypto interface, in conjunction with MetaMask as our wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. ENS timeline for registration\n\n\nFirst, we need to make sure the name we want is available. While writing this book, we really wanted to register the name mastering.eth, but alas, Searching for ENS names on MyCrypto.com revealed it was already taken! Because ENS registrations only last one year, it might become possible to secure that name in the future. In the meantime, let’s search for ethereumbook.eth (Searching for ENS names on MyCrypto.com).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Searching for ENS names on MyCrypto.com\n\n\nGreat! The name is available. In order to register it, we need to move forward with Starting an auction for an ENS name. Let’s unlock MetaMask and start an auction for ethereumbook.eth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Starting an auction for an ENS name\n\n\nLet’s make our bid. In order to do that we need to follow the steps in Placing a bid for an ENS name.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Placing a bid for an ENS name\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in Vickrey auctions, you must reveal your bid within 48 hours after the auction is complete, or you lose the funds in your bid. Did we forget to do this and lose 0.01 ETH ourselves? You bet we did.\n\n\nTake a screenshot, save your secret phrase (as a backup for your bid), and add a reminder in your calendar for the reveal date and time, so you don’t forget and lose your funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we confirm the transaction by clicking the big green submit button shown in MetaMask transaction containing your bid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. MetaMask transaction containing your bid\n\n\nIf all goes well, after submitting a transaction in this way you can return and reveal the bid in 48 hours, and the name you requested will be registered to your Ethereum address.\n\n\n\nManaging Your ENS Name\n\nOnce you have registered an ENS name, you can manage it using another user-friendly interface: ENS Manager.\n\n\nOnce there, enter the name you want to manage in the search box (see The ENS Manager web interface). You need to have your Ethereum wallet  (e.g., MetaMask) unlocked, so that the ENS Manager DApp can manage the name on your behalf.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10. The ENS Manager web interface\n\n\nFrom this interface, we can create subdomains, set a resolver contract (more on that later), and connect each name to the appropriate resource, such as the Swarm address of a DApp frontend.\n\n\nCreating an ENS subdomain\n\nFirst, let’s create a subdomain for our example Auction DApp (see Adding the subdomain auction.ethereumbook.eth). We will name the subdomain auction, so the fully qualified name will be auction.ethereumbook.eth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Adding the subdomain auction.ethereumbook.eth\n\n\nOnce we’ve created the subdomain, we can enter auction.ethereumbook.eth in the search box and manage it, just as we managed the domain ethereumbook.eth previously.\n\n\n\n\nENS Resolvers\n\nIn ENS, resolving a name is a two-step process:\n\n\n\n\nThe ENS registry is called with the name to resolve after hashing it.\nIf the record exists, the registry returns the address of its resolver.\n\n\nThe resolver is called, using the method appropriate to the resource being requested. The resolver returns the desired result.\n\n\n\n\nThis two-step process has several benefits. Separating the functionality of resolvers from the naming system itself gives us a lot more flexibility. The owners of names can use custom resolvers to resolve any type or resource, extending the functionality of ENS. For example, if in the future you wanted to link a geolocation resource (longitude/lattitude) to an ENS name, you could create a new resolver that answers a geolocation query. Who knows what applications might be useful in the future? With custom resolvers, the only limitation is your imagination.\n\n\nFor convenience, there is a default public resolver that can resolve a variety of resources, including the address (for wallets or contracts) and content (a Swarm hash for DApps or contract source code).\n\n\nSince we want to link our Auction DApp to a Swarm hash, we can use the public resolver, which supports content resolution, as shown in Setting the default public resolver for auction.ethereumbook.eth; we don’t need to code or deploy a custom resolver.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Setting the default public resolver for auction.ethereumbook.eth\n\n\n\nResolving a Name to a Swarm Hash (Content)\n\nOnce the resolver for auction.ethereumbook.eth is set to be the public resolver, we can set it to return the Swarm hash as the content of our name (see Setting the 'content' to return for auction.ethereumbook.eth).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Setting the 'content' to return for auction.ethereumbook.eth\n\n\nAfter waiting a short time for our transaction to be confirmed, we should be able to resolve the name correctly. Before setting a name, our Auction DApp could be found on a Swarm gateway by its hash:\n\n\nhttps://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/ab164cf37dc10647e43a233486cdeffa8334b026e32a480dd9cbd020c12d4581\n\n\nor by searching in a DApp browser or Swarm gateway for the Swarm URL:\n\n\nbzz://ab164cf37dc10647e43a233486cdeffa8334b026e32a480dd9cbd020c12d4581\n\n\nNow that we have attached it to a name, it is much easier:\n\n\nhttp://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/auction.ethereumbook.eth/\n\n\nWe can also find it by searching for \"auction.ethereumbook.eth\" in any ENS-compatible wallet or DApp browser (e.g., Mist).\n\n\n\n\nFrom App to DApp\n\nOver the past several sections, we have gradually built a decentralized application. We started with a pair of smart contracts to run an auction for ERC721 deeds. These contracts were designed to have no governing or privileged accounts, so that their operation is truly decentralized. We  added a frontend, implemented in JavaScript, that offers a convenient and user-friendly interface to our DApp. The auction DApp uses the decentralized storage system Swarm to store application resources such as images. The DApp also uses the decentralized communications protocol Whisper to offer an encrypted chat room for each auction, without any central servers.\n\n\nWe uploaded the entire frontend to Swarm, so that our DApp doesn’t rely on any web servers to serve the files. Finally, we allocated a name for our DApp using ENS, connecting it to the Swarm hash of the frontend, so that users can access it with a simple and easy-to-remember human-readable name.\n\n\nWith each of these steps, we increased the decentralization of our application. The final result is a DApp that has no central point of authority, no central point of failure, and expresses the \"web3\" vision.\n\n\nAuction DApp architecture shows the complete architecture of the Auction DApp.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Auction DApp architecture\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nDecentralized applications are the culmination of the Ethereum vision, as expressed by the founders from the very earliest designs. While a lot of applications call themselves \"DApps\" today, most are not fully decentralized. However, it is already possible to construct applications that are almost completely decentralized. Over time, as the technology matures further, more and more of our applications can be decentralized, resulting in a more resilient, censorship-resistant, and free web.\n\n\n\n"},"13evm.html":{"url":"13evm.html","title":"Chapter 13: The Ethereum Virtual Machine","keywords":"","body":"\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\n\nAt the heart of the Ethereum protocol and operation is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM for short. As you might guess from the name, it is a computation engine, not hugely dissimilar to the virtual machines of Microsoft’s .NET Framework, or interpreters of other bytecode-compiled programming languages such as Java. In this chapter we take a detailed look at the EVM, including its instruction set, structure, and operation, within the context of Ethereum state updates.\n\n\nWhat Is the EVM?\n\nThe EVM is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution. Simple value transfer transactions from one EOA to another don’t need to involve it, practically speaking, but everything else will involve a state update computed by the EVM. At a high level, the EVM running on the Ethereum blockchain can be thought of as a global decentralized computer containing millions of executable objects, each with its own permanent data store.\n\n\nThe EVM is a quasi–Turing-complete state machine; \"quasi\" because all execution processes are limited to a finite number of computational steps by the amount of gas available for any given smart contract execution. As such, the halting problem is \"solved\" (all program executions will halt) and the situation where execution might (accidentally or maliciously) run forever, thus bringing the Ethereum platform to halt in its entirety, is avoided.\n\n\nThe EVM has a stack-based architecture, storing all in-memory values on a stack. It works with a word size of 256 bits (mainly to facilitate native hashing and elliptic curve operations) and has several addressable data components:\n\n\n\n\nAn immutable program code ROM, loaded with the bytecode of the smart contract to be executed\n\n\nA volatile memory, with every location explicitly initialized to zero\n\n\nA permanent storage that is part of the Ethereum state, also zero-initialized\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a set of environment variables and data that is available during execution. We will go through these in more detail later in this chapter.\n\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Architecture and Execution Context shows the EVM architecture and execution context.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Architecture and Execution Context\n\n\nComparison with Existing Technology\n\nThe term \"virtual machine\" is often applied to the virtualization of a real computer, typically by a \"hypervisor\" such as VirtualBox or QEMU, or of an entire operating system instance, such as Linux’s KVM. These must provide a software abstraction, respectively, of actual hardware, and of system calls and other kernel functionality.\n\n\nThe EVM operates in a much more limited domain: it is just a computation engine, and as such provides an abstraction of just computation and storage, similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) specification, for example. From a high-level viewpoint, the JVM is designed to provide a runtime environment that is agnostic of the underlying host OS or hardware, enabling compatibility across a wide variety of systems. High-level programming languages such as Java or Scala (which use the JVM) or C# (which uses .NET) are compiled into the bytecode instruction set of their respective virtual machine. In the same way, the EVM executes its own bytecode instruction set (described in the next section), which higher-level smart contract programming languages such as LLL, Serpent, Mutan, or Solidity are compiled into.\n\n\nThe EVM, therefore, has no scheduling capability, because execution ordering is organized externally to it—Ethereum clients run through verified block transactions to determine which smart contracts need executing and in which order. In this sense, the Ethereum world computer is single-threaded, like JavaScript. Neither does the EVM have any \"system interface\" handling or “hardware support”—there is no physical machine to interface with. The Ethereum world computer is completely virtual.\n\n\n\nThe EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode Operations)\n\nThe EVM instruction set offers most of the operations you might expect, including:\n\n\n\n\nArithmetic and bitwise logic operations\n\n\nExecution context inquiries\n\n\nStack, memory, and storage access\n\n\nControl flow operations\n\n\nLogging, calling, and other operators\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the typical bytecode operations, the EVM also has access to account information (e.g., address and balance) and block information (e.g., block number and current gas price).\n\n\nLet’s start our exploration of the EVM in more detail by looking at the available opcodes and what they do. As you might expect, all operands are taken from the stack, and the result (where applicable) is often\nput back on the top of the stack.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA complete list of opcodes and their corresponding gas cost can be found in [evm_opcodes].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe available opcodes can be divided into the following categories:\n\n\n\nArithmetic operations\n\nArithmetic opcode instructions:\n\n\nADD        //Add the top two stack items\nMUL        //Multiply the top two stack items\nSUB        //Subtract the top two stack items\nDIV        //Integer division\nSDIV       //Signed integer division\nMOD        //Modulo (remainder) operation\nSMOD       //Signed modulo operation\nADDMOD     //Addition modulo any number\nMULMOD     //Multiplication modulo any number\nEXP

the Ethereum state by computing valid state transitions as a result of smart contract code execution, as defined by the Ethereum protocol. This aspect leads to the description of Ethereum as a transaction-based state machine, which reflects the fact that external actors (i.e., account holders and miners) initiate state transitions by creating, accepting, and ordering transactions. It is useful at this point to consider what constitutes the Ethereum state.\n\n\nAt the top level, we have the Ethereum world state. The world state is a mapping of Ethereum addresses (160-bit values) to accounts. At the lower level, each Ethereum address represents an account comprising an ether balance (stored as the number of wei owned by the account), a nonce (representing the number of transactions successfully sent from this account if it is an EOA, or the number of contracts created by it if it is a contract account), the account’s storage (which is a permanent data store, only used by smart contracts), and the account’s program code (again, only if the account is a smart contract account). An EOA will always have no code and an empty storage.\n\n\nWhen a transaction results in smart contract code execution, an EVM is instantiated with all the information required in relation to the current block being created and the specific transaction being processed. In particular, the EVM’s program code ROM is loaded with the code of the contract account being called, the program counter is set to zero, the storage is loaded from the contract account’s storage, the memory is set to all zeros, and all the block and environment variables are set. A key variable is the gas supply for this execution, which is set to the amount of gas paid for by the sender at the start of the transaction (see Gas for more details). As code execution progresses, the gas supply is reduced according to the gas cost of the operations executed. If at any point the gas supply is reduced to zero we get an \"Out of Gas\" (OOG) exception; execution immediately halts and the transaction is abandoned. No changes to the Ethereum state are applied, except for the sender’s nonce being incremented and their ether balance going down to pay the block’s beneficiary for the resources used to execute the code to the halting point. At this point, you can think of the EVM running on a sandboxed copy of the Ethereum world state, with this sandboxed version being discarded completely if execution cannot complete for whatever reason. However, if execution does complete successfully, then the real-world state is updated to match the sandboxed version, including any changes to the called contract’s storage data, any new contracts created, and any ether balance transfers that were initiated.\n\n\nNote that because a smart contract can itself effectively initiate transactions, code execution is a recursive process. A contract can call other contracts, with each call resulting in another EVM being instantiated around the new target of the call. Each instantiation has its sandbox world state initialized from the sandbox of the EVM at the level above. Each instantiation is also given a specified amount of gas for its gas supply (not exceeding the amount of gas remaining in the level above, of course), and so may itself halt with an exception due to being given too little gas to complete its execution. Again, in such cases, the sandbox state is discarded, and execution returns to the EVM at the level above.\n\n\n\nCompiling Solidity to EVM Bytecode\n\nCompiling a Solidity source file to EVM bytecode can be accomplished via several methods. In [intro_chapter] we used the online Remix compiler. In this chapter, we will use the solc executable at the command line. For a list of options, run the following command:\n\n\n$ solc --help\n\n\nGenerating the raw opcode stream of a Solidity source file is easily achieved with the --opcodes command-line option. This opcode stream leaves out some information (the --asm option produces the full information), but it is sufficient for this discussion. For example, compiling an example Solidity file, Example.sol, and sending the opcode output into a directory named BytecodeDir is accomplished with the following command:\n\n\n$ solc -o BytecodeDir --opcodes Example.sol\n\n\nor:\n\n\n$ solc -o BytecodeDir --asm Example.sol\n\n\nThe following command will produce the bytecode binary for our example program:\n\n\n$ solc -o BytecodeDir --bin Example.sol\n\n\nThe output opcode files generated will depend on the specific contracts contained within the Solidity source file. Our simple Solidity file Example.sol has only one contract, named example:\n\n\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n\ncontract example {\n\n  address contractOwner;\n\n  function example() {\n    contractOwner = msg.sender;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, all this contract does is hold one persistent state variable, which is set as the address of the last account to run this contract.\n\n\nIf you look in the BytecodeDir directory you will see the opcode file example.opcode, which contains the EVM opcode instructions of the example contract. Opening the example.opcode file in a text editor will show the following:\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE ISZERO PUSH1 0xE JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1\nREVERT JUMPDEST CALLER PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 PUSH2 0x100 EXP DUP2 SLOAD DUP2 PUSH20\n0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF MUL NOT AND SWAP1 DUP4 PUSH20\n0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND MUL OR SWAP1 SSTORE POP PUSH1\n0x35 DUP1 PUSH1 0x5B PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0x0 RETURN STOP PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1\n0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT STOP LOG1 PUSH6 0x627A7A723058 KECCAK256 JUMP\n0xb9 SWAP14 0xcb 0x1e 0xdd RETURNDATACOPY 0xec 0xe0 0x1f 0x27 0xc9 PUSH5\n0x9C5ABCC14A NUMBER 0x5e INVALID EXTCODESIZE 0xdb 0xcf EXTCODESIZE 0x27\nEXTCODESIZE 0xe2 0xb8 SWAP10 0xed 0x\n\n\n\nCompiling the example with the --asm option produces a file named example.evm in our BytecodeDir directory. This contains a slightly higher-level description of the EVM bytecode instructions, together with some helpful annotations:\n\n\n\n/* \"Example.sol\":26:132  contract example {... */\n  mstore(0x40, 0x60)\n    /* \"Example.sol\":74:130  function example() {... */\n  jumpi(tag_1, iszero(callvalue))\n  0x0\n  dup1\n  revert\ntag_1:\n    /* \"Example.sol\":115:125  msg.sender */\n  caller\n    /* \"Example.sol\":99:112  contractOwner */\n  0x0\n  dup1\n    /* \"Example.sol\":99:125  contractOwner = msg.sender */\n  0x100\n  exp\n  dup2\n  sload\n  dup2\n  0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n  mul\n  not\n  and\n  swap1\n  dup4\n  0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n  and\n  mul\n  or\n  swap1\n  sstore\n  pop\n    /* \"Example.sol\":26:132  contract example {... */\n  dataSize(sub_0)\n  dup1\n  dataOffset(sub_0)\n  0x0\n  codecopy\n  0x0\n  return\nstop\n\nsub_0: assembly {\n        /* \"Example.sol\":26:132  contract example {... */\n      mstore(0x40, 0x60)\n      0x0\n      dup1\n      revert\n\n    auxdata: 0xa165627a7a7230582056b99dcb1edd3eece01f27c9649c5abcc14a435efe3b...\n}\n\n\n\nThe --bin-runtime option produces the machine-readable hexadecimal bytecode:\n\n\n\n60606040523415600e57600080fd5b336000806101000a81548173\nffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n021916908373\nffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n160217905550603580605b6000396000f3006060604052600080fd00a165627a7a7230582056b...\n\n\n\nYou can investigate what’s going on here in detail using the opcode list given in The EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode Operations). However, that’s quite a task, so let’s just start by examining the first four instructions:\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE\n\n\n\nHere we have PUSH1 followed by a raw byte of value 0x60. This EVM instruction takes the single byte following the opcode in the program code (as a literal value) and pushes it onto the stack. It is possible to push values of size up to 32 bytes onto the stack, as in:\n\n\n\nPUSH32 0x436f6e67726174756c6174696f6e732120536f6f6e20746f206d617374657221\n\n\n\nThe second PUSH1 opcode from example.opcode stores 0x40 onto the top of the stack (pushing the 0x60 already present there down one slot).\n\n\nNext is MSTORE, which is a memory store operation that saves a value to the EVM’s memory. It takes two arguments and, like most EVM operations, obtains them from the stack. For each argument the stack is “popped”; i.e., the top value on the stack is taken off and all the other values on the stack are shifted up one position. The first argument for MSTORE is the address of the word in memory where the value to be saved will be put. For this program we have 0x40 at the top of the stack, so that is removed from the stack and used as the memory address. The second argument is the value to be saved, which is 0x60 here. After the MSTORE operation is executed our stack is empty again, but we have the value 0x60 (96 in decimal) at the memory location 0x40.\n\n\nThe next opcode is CALLVALUE, which is an environmental opcode that pushes onto the top of the stack the amount of ether (measured in wei) sent with the message call that initiated this execution.\n\n\nWe could continue to step through this program in this way until we had a full understanding of the low-level state changes that this code effects, but it wouldn’t help us at this stage. We’ll come back to it later in the chapter.\n\n\n\nContract Deployment Code\n\nThere is an important but subtle difference between the code used when creating and deploying a new contract on the Ethereum platform and the code of the contract itself. In order to create a new contract, a special transaction is needed that has its to field set to the special 0x0 address and its data field set to the contract’s initiation code. When such a contract creation transaction is processed, the code for the new contract account is not the code in the data field of the transaction. Instead, an EVM is instantiated with the code in the data field of the transaction loaded into its program code ROM, and then the output of the execution of that deployment code is taken as the code for the new contract account. This is so that new contracts can be programmatically initialized using the Ethereum world state at the time of deployment, setting values in the contract’s storage and even sending ether or creating further new contracts.\n\n\nWhen compiling a contract offline, e.g., using solc on the command line, you can either get the deployment bytecode or the runtime bytecode.\n\n\nThe deployment bytecode is used for every aspect of the initialization of a new contract account, including the bytecode that will actually end up being executed when transactions call this new contract (i.e., the runtime bytecode) and the code to initialize everything based on the contract’s constructor.\n\n\nThe runtime bytecode, on the other hand, is exactly the bytecode that ends up being executed when the new contract is called, and nothing more; it does not include the bytecode needed to initialize the contract during deployment.\n\n\nLet’s take the simple Faucet.sol contract we created earlier as an example:\n\n\n\n// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for\npragma solidity ^0.4.19;\n\n// Our first contract is a faucet!\ncontract Faucet {\n\n  // Give out ether to anyone who asks\n  function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {\n\n      // Limit withdrawal amount\n      require(withdraw_amount \n\n\n\nTo get the deployment bytecode, we would run solc --bin Faucet.sol. If we instead wanted just the runtime bytecode, we would run solc --bin-runtime Faucet.sol.\n\n\nIf you compare the output of these commands, you will see that the runtime bytecode is a subset of the deployment bytecode. In other words, the runtime bytecode is entirely contained within the deployment bytecode.\n\n\n\nDisassembling the Bytecode\n\nDisassembling EVM bytecode is a great way to understand how high-level Solidity acts in the EVM. There are a few disassemblers you can use to do this:\n\n\n\n\nPorosity is a popular open source decompiler.\n\n\nEthersplay is an EVM plug-in for Binary Ninja, a disassembler.\n\n\nIDA-Evm is an EVM plugin for IDA, another disassembler.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will be using the Ethersplay plug-in for Binary Ninja and to start Disassembling the Faucet runtime bytecode. After getting the runtime bytecode of Faucet.sol, we can feed it into Binary Ninja (after loading the Ethersplay plug-in) to see what the EVM instructions look like.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Disassembling the Faucet runtime bytecode\n\n\nWhen you send a transaction to an ABI-compatible smart contract (which you can assume all contracts are), the transaction first interacts with that smart contract’s dispatcher. The dispatcher reads in the data field of the transaction and sends the relevant part to the appropriate function. We can see an example of a dispatcher at the beginning of our disassembled Faucet.sol runtime bytecode. After the familiar MSTORE instruction, we see the following instructions:\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x4\nCALLDATASIZE\nLT\nPUSH1 0x3f\nJUMPI\n\n\n\nAs we have seen, PUSH1 0x4 places 0x4 onto the top of the stack, which is otherwise empty. CALLDATASIZE gets the size in bytes of the data sent with the transaction (known as the calldata) and pushes that number onto the stack. After these operations have been executed, the stack looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n0x4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next instruction is LT, short for “less than.” The LT instruction checks whether the top item on the stack is less than the next item on the stack. In our case, it checks to see if the result of CALLDATASIZE is less than 4 bytes.\n\n\nWhy does the EVM check to see that the calldata of the transaction is at least 4 bytes? Because of how function identifiers work. Each function is identified by the first 4 bytes of its Keccak-256 hash. By placing the function’s name and what arguments it takes into a keccak256 hash function, we can deduce its function identifier. In our case, we have:\n\n\n\nkeccak256(\"withdraw(uint256)\") = 0x2e1a7d4d...\n\n\n\nThus, the function identifier for the withdraw(uint256) function is 0x2e1a7d4d, since these are the first 4 bytes of the resulting hash. A function identifier is always 4 bytes long, so if the entire data field of the transaction sent to the contract is less than 4 bytes, then there’s no function with which the transaction could possibly be communicating, unless a fallback function is defined. Because we implemented such a fallback function in Faucet.sol, the EVM jumps to this function when the calldata’s length is less than 4 bytes.\n\n\nLT pops the top two values off the stack and, if the transaction’s data field is less than 4 bytes, pushes 1 onto it. Otherwise, it pushes 0. In our example, let’s assume the data field of the transaction sent to our contract was less than 4 bytes.\n\n\nThe PUSH1 0x3f instruction pushes the byte 0x3f onto the stack. After this instruction, the stack looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n0x3f\n\n\n\n\nThe next instruction is JUMPI, which stands for \"jump if.\" It works like so:\n\n\n\njumpi(label, cond) // Jump to \"label\" if \"cond\" is true\n\n\n\nIn our case, label is 0x3f, which is where our fallback function lives in our smart contract. The cond argument is 1, which was the result of the LT instruction earlier. To put this entire sequence into words, the contract jumps to the fallback function if the transaction data is less than 4 bytes.\n\n\nAt 0x3f, only a STOP instruction follows, because although we declared a fallback function, we kept it empty. As you can see in JUMPI instruction leading to fallback function, had we not implemented a fallback function, the contract would throw an exception instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. JUMPI instruction leading to fallback function\n\n\nLet’s examine the central block of the dispatcher. Assuming we received calldata that was greater than 4 bytes in length, the JUMPI instruction would not jump to the fallback function. Instead, code execution would proceed to the following instructions:\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x0\nCALLDATALOAD\nPUSH29 0x1000000...\nSWAP1\nDIV\nPUSH4 0xffffffff\nAND\nDUP1\nPUSH4 0x2e1a7d4d\nEQ\nPUSH1 0x41\nJUMPI\n\n\n\nPUSH1 0x0 pushes 0 onto the stack, which is now otherwise empty again. CALLDATALOAD accepts as an argument an index within the calldata sent to the smart contract and reads 32 bytes from that index, like so:\n\n\n\ncalldataload(p) //load 32 bytes of calldata starting from byte position p\n\n\n\nSince 0 was the index passed to it from the PUSH1 0x0 command, CALLDATALOAD reads 32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0, and then pushes it to the top of the stack (after popping the original 0x0). After the PUSH29 0x1000000…​ instruction, the stack is then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x1000000…​ (29 bytes in length)\n\n\n\n\nSWAP1 switches the top element on the stack with the i-th element after it. In this case, it swaps 0x1000000…​ with the calldata. The new stack is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n0x1000000…​ (29 bytes in length)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next instruction is DIV, which works as follows:\n\n\n\ndiv(x, y) // integer division x / y\n\n\n\nIn this case, x = 32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0, and y = 0x100000000…​ (29 bytes total). Can you think of why the dispatcher is doing the division? Here’s a hint: we read 32 bytes from calldata earlier, starting at index 0. The first 4 bytes of that calldata is the function identifier.\n\n\nThe 0x100000000…​ we pushed earlier is 29 bytes long, consisting of a 1 at the beginning, followed by all 0s. Dividing our 32 bytes of calldata by this value will leave us only the topmost 4 bytes of our calldata load, starting at index 0. These 4 bytes—the first 4 bytes in the calldata starting at index 0—are the function identifier, and this is how the EVM extracts that field.\n\n\nIf this part isn’t clear to you, think of it like this: in base 10, 1234000 / 1000 = 1234. In base 16, this is no different. Instead of every place being a multiple of 10, it is a multiple of 16. Just as dividing by 103 (1000) in our smaller example kept only the topmost digits, dividing our 32-byte base 16 value by 1629 does the same.\n\n\nThe result of the DIV (the function identifier) gets pushed onto the stack, and our stack is now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the PUSH4 0xffffffff and AND instructions are redundant, we can ignore them entirely, as the stack will remain the same after they are done. The DUP1 instruction duplicates the first item on the stack, which is the function identifier. The next instruction, PUSH4 0x2e1a7d4d, pushes the precalculated function identifier of the withdraw(uint256) function onto the stack. The stack is now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x2e1a7d4d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next instruction, EQ, pops off the top two items of the stack and compares them. This is where the dispatcher does its main job: it compares whether the function identifier sent in the msg.data field of the transaction matches that of withdraw(uint256). If they are equal, EQ pushes 1 onto the stack, which will ultimately be used to jump to the withdraw function. Otherwise, EQ pushes 0 onto the stack.\n\n\nAssuming the transaction sent to our contract indeed began with the function identifier for withdraw(uint256), our stack has become:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\n (now known to be 0x2e1a7d4d)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have PUSH1 0x41, which is the address at which the withdraw(uint256) function lives in the contract. After this instruction, the stack looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\n\n\n\nfunction identifier sent in msg.data\n\n\n\n\n0x41\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nThe JUMPI instruction is next, and it once again accepts the top two elements on the stack as arguments. In this case, we have jumpi(0x41, 1), which tells the EVM to execute the jump to the location of the withdraw(uint256) function, and the execution of that function’s code can proceed.\n\n\n\n\nTuring Completeness and Gas\n\nAs we have already touched on, in simple terms, a system or programming language is Turing complete if it can run any program. This capability, however, comes with an very important caveat: some programs take forever to run. An important aspect of this is that we can’t tell, just by looking at a program, whether it will take forever or not to execute. We have to actually go through with the execution of the program and wait for it to finish to find out. Of course, if it is going to take forever to execute, we will have to wait forever to find out. This is called the halting problem and would be a huge problem for Ethereum if it were not addressed.\n\n\nBecause of the halting problem, the Ethereum world computer is at risk of being asked to execute a program that never stops. This could be by accident or malice. We have discussed that Ethereum acts like a single-threaded machine, without any scheduler, and so if it became stuck in an infinite loop this would mean it would become unusable.\n\n\nHowever, with gas, there is a solution: if after a prespecified maximum amount of computation has been performed, the execution hasn’t ended, the execution of the program is halted by the EVM. This makes the EVM a quasi–Turing-complete machine: it can run any program you feed into it, but only if the program terminates within a particular amount of computation. That limit isn’t fixed in Ethereum—you can pay to increase it up to a maximum (called the \"block gas limit\"), and everyone can agree to increase that maximum over time. Nevertheless, at any one time, there is a limit in place, and transactions that consume too much gas while executing are halted.\n\n\nIn the following sections, we will look at gas and examine how it works in detail.\n\n\n\nGas\n\nGas is Ethereum’s unit for measuring the computational and storage resources required to perform actions on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to Bitcoin, whose transaction fees only take into account the size of a transaction in kilobytes, Ethereum must account for every computational step performed by transactions and smart contract code execution.\n\n\nEach operation performed by a transaction or contract costs a fixed amount of gas. Some examples, from the Ethereum Yellow Paper:\n\n\n\n\nAdding two numbers costs 3 gas\n\n\nCalculating a Keccak-256 hash costs 30 gas + 6 gas for each 256 bits of data being hashed\n\n\nSending a transaction costs 21,000 gas\n\n\n\n\nGas is a crucial component of Ethereum, and serves a dual role: as a buffer between the (volatile) price of Ethereum and the reward to miners for the work they do, and as a defense against denial-of-service attacks. To prevent accidental or malicious infinite loops or other computational wastage in the network, the initiator of each transaction is required to set a limit to the amount of computation they are willing to pay for. The gas system thereby disincentivizes attackers from sending \"spam\" transactions, as they must pay proportionately for the computational, bandwidth, and storage resources that they consume.\n\n\nGas Accounting During Execution\n\nWhen an EVM is needed to complete a transaction, in the first instance it is given a gas supply equal to the amount specified by the gas limit in the transaction. Every opcode that is executed has a cost in gas, and so the EVM’s gas supply is reduced as the EVM steps through the program. Before each operation, the EVM checks that there is enough gas to pay for the operation’s execution. If there isn’t enough gas, execution is halted and the transaction is reverted.\n\n\nIf the EVM reaches the end of execution successfully, without running out of gas, the  gas cost used is paid to the miner as a transaction fee, converted to ether based on the gas price specified in the transaction:\n\n\n\nminer fee = gas cost * gas price\n\n\n\nThe gas remaining in the gas supply is refunded to the sender, again converted to ether based on the gas price specified in the transaction:\n\n\n\nremaining gas = gas limit - gas cost\nrefunded ether = remaining gas * gas price\n\n\n\nIf the transaction “runs out of gas” during execution, the operation is immediately terminated, raising an “out of gas” exception. The transaction is reverted and all changes to the state are rolled back.\n\n\nAlthough the transaction was unsuccessful, the sender will be charged a transaction fee, as miners have already performed the computational work up to that point and must be compensated for doing so.\n\n\n\nGas Accounting Considerations\n\nThe relative gas costs of the various operations that can be performed by the EVM have been carefully chosen to best protect the Ethereum blockchain from attack. You can see a detailed table of gas costs for different EVM opcodes in [evm_opcodes_table].\n\n\nMore computationally intensive operations cost more gas. For example, executing the SHA3 function is 10 times more expensive (30 gas) than the ADD operation (3 gas). More importantly, some operations, such as EXP, require an additional payment based on the size of the operand. There is also a gas cost to using EVM memory and for storing data in a contract’s on-chain storage.\n\n\nThe importance of matching gas cost to the real-world cost of resources was demonstrated in 2016 when an attacker found and exploited a mismatch in costs. The attack generated transactions that were very computationally expensive, and made the Ethereum mainnet almost grind to a halt. This mismatch was resolved by a hard fork (codenamed \"Tangerine Whistle\") that tweaked the relative gas costs.\n\n\n\nGas Cost Versus Gas Price\n\nWhile the gas cost is a measure of computation and storage used in the EVM, the gas itself also has a price measured in ether. When performing a transaction, the sender specifies the gas price they are willing to pay (in ether) for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations (as measured in gas):\n\n\n\ntransaction fee = total gas used * gas price paid  (in ether)\n\n\n\nWhen constructing a new block, miners on the Ethereum network can choose among pending transactions by selecting those that offer to pay a higher gas price. Offering a higher gas price will therefore incentivize miners to include your transaction and get it confirmed faster.\n\n\nIn practice, the sender of a transaction will set a gas limit that is higher than or equal to the amount of gas expected to be used. If the gas limit is set higher than the amount of gas consumed, the sender will receive a refund of the excess amount, as miners are only compensated for the work they actually perform.\n\n\nIt is important to be clear about the distinction between the gas cost and the gas price. To recap:\n\n\n\n\nGas cost is the number of units of gas required to perform a particular operation.\n\n\nGas price is the amount of ether you are willing to pay per unit of gas when you send your transaction to the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile gas has a price, it cannot be \"owned\" nor \"spent.\" Gas exists only inside the EVM, as a count of how much computational work is being performed. The sender is charged a transaction fee in ether, which is then converted to gas for EVM accounting and then back to ether as a transaction fee paid to the miners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative gas costs\n\nEthereum encourages the deletion of used storage variables and accounts by refunding some of the gas used during contract execution.\n\n\nThere are two operations in the EVM with negative gas costs:\n\n\n\n\nDeleting a contract (SELFDESTRUCT) is worth a refund of 24,000 gas.\n\n\nChanging a storage address from a nonzero value to zero (SSTORE[x] = 0) is worth a refund of 15,000 gas.\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid exploitation of the refund mechanism, the maximum refund for a transaction is set to half the total amount of gas used (rounded down).\n\n\n\n\nBlock Gas Limit\n\nThe block gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that may be consumed by all the transactions in a block, and constrains how many transactions can fit into a block.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say we have 5 transactions whose gas limits have been set to 30,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, and 50,000. If the block gas limit is 180,000, then any four of those transactions can fit in a block, while the fifth will have to wait for a future block. As previously discussed, miners decide which transactions to include in a block. Different miners are likely to select different combinations, mainly because they receive transactions from the network in a different order.\n\n\nIf a miner tries to include a transaction that requires more gas than the current block gas limit, the block will be rejected by the network. Most Ethereum clients will stop you from issuing such a transaction by giving a warning along the lines of “transaction exceeds block gas limit.” The block gas limit on the Ethereum mainnet is 8 million gas at the time of writing according to https://etherscan.io, meaning that around 380 basic transactions (each consuming 21,000 gas) could fit into a block.\n\n\nWho decides what the block gas limit is?\n\nThe miners on the network collectively decide the block gas limit. Individuals who want to mine on the Ethereum network use a mining program, such as Ethminer, which connects to a Geth or Parity Ethereum client. The Ethereum protocol has a built-in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit so capacity can be increased or decreased in subsequent blocks. The miner of a block can vote to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1,024 (0.0976%) in either direction. The result of this is an adjustable block size based on the needs of the network at the time. This mechanism is coupled with a default mining strategy where miners vote on a gas limit that is at least 4.7 million gas, but which targets a value of 150% of the average of recent total gas usage per block (using a 1,024-block exponential moving average).\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we have explored the Ethereum Virtual Machine, tracing the execution of various smart contracts and looking at how the EVM executes bytecode. We also looked at gas, the EVM’s accounting mechanism, and saw how it solves the halting problem and protects Ethereum from denial-of-service attacks. Next, in [consensus], we will look at the mechanism used by Ethereum to achieve decentralized consensus.\n\n\n\n"},"14consensus.html":{"url":"14consensus.html","title":"Chapter 14: Consensus","keywords":"","body":"\nConsensus\n\n\nThroughout this book we have talked about \"consensus rules”—the rules that everyone must agree to for the system to operate in a decentralized, yet deterministic, manner. In computer science, the term consensus predates blockchains and is related to the broader problem of synchronizing state in distributed systems, such that different participants in a distributed system all (eventually) agree on a single system-wide state. This is called \"reaching consensus.\"\n\n\nWhen it comes to the core function of decentralized record keeping and verification, it can become problematic to rely on trust alone to ensure that information derived from state updates is correct. This rather general challenge is particularly pronounced in decentralized networks because there is no central entity to decide what is true. The lack of a central decision-making entity is one of the main attractions of blockchain platforms, because of the resulting capacity to resist censorship and the lack of dependence on authority for permission to access information. However, these benefits come at a cost: without a trusted arbitrator, any disagreements, deceptions, or differences need to be reconciled using other means. Consensus algorithms are the  mechanism used to reconcile security and decentralization.\n\n\nIn blockchains, consensus is a critical property of the system. Simply put, there is money at stake! So, in the context of blockchains, consensus is about being able to arrive at a common state, while maintaining decentralization. In other words, consensus is intended to produce a system of strict rules without rulers. There is no one person, organization, or group \"in charge”; rather, power and control are diffused across a broad network of participants, whose self-interest is served by following the rules and behaving honestly.\n\n\nThe ability to come to consensus across a distributed network, under adversarial conditions, without centralizing control is the core principle of all open public blockchains. To address this challenge and maintain the valued property of decentralization, the community continues to experiment with different models of consensus. This chapter explores these consensus models and their expected impact on smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile consensus algorithms are an important part of how blockchains work, they operate at a foundational layer, far below the abstraction of smart contracts. In other words, most of the details of consensus are hidden from the writers of smart contracts. You don’t need to know how they work to use Ethereum, any more than you need to know how routing works to use the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsensus via Proof of Work\n\nThe creator of the original blockchain, Bitcoin, invented a consensus algorithm called proof of work (PoW). Arguably, PoW is the most important invention underpinning Bitcoin. The colloquial term for PoW is \"mining,\" which creates a misunderstanding about the primary purpose of consensus. Often people assume that the purpose of mining is the creation of new currency, since the purpose of real-world mining is the extraction of precious metals or other resources. Rather, the real purpose of mining (and all other consensus models) is to secure the blockchain, while keeping control over the system decentralized and diffused across as many participants as possible. The reward of newly minted currency is an incentive to those who contribute to the security of the system: a means to an end. In that sense, the reward is the means and decentralized security is the end. In PoW consensus there is also a corresponding \"punishment,\" which is the cost of energy required to participate in mining. If participants do not follow the rules and earn the reward, they risk the funds they have already spent on electricity to mine. Thus, PoW consensus is a careful balance of risk and reward that drives participants to behave honestly out of self-interest.\n\n\nEthereum is currently a PoW blockchain, in that it uses a PoW algorithm with the same basic incentive system for the same basic goal: securing the blockchain while decentralizing control. Ethereum’s PoW algorithm is slightly different than Bitcoin’s and is called Ethash. We will examine the function and design characteristics of the algorithm in Ethash: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work Algorithm.\n\n\n\nConsensus via Proof of Stake (PoS)\n\nHistorically, proof of work was not the first consensus algorithm proposed. Preceding the introduction of proof of work, many researchers had proposed variations of consensus algorithms based on financial stake, now called proof of stake (PoS). In some respects, proof of work was invented as an alternative to proof of stake. Following the success of Bitcoin, many blockchains have emulated proof of work. Yet the explosion of research into consensus algorithms has also resurrected proof of stake, significantly advancing the state of the technology. From the beginning, Ethereum’s founders were hoping to eventually migrate its consensus algorithm to proof of stake. In fact, there is a deliberate handicap on Ethereum’s proof of work called the difficulty bomb, intended to gradually make proof-of-work mining of Ethereum more and more difficult, thereby forcing the transition to proof of stake.\n\n\nAt the time of publication of this book, Ethereum is still using proof of work, but the ongoing research toward a proof-of-stake alternative is nearing completion. Ethereum’s planned PoS algorithm is called Casper. The introduction of Casper as a replacement for Ethash has been postponed several times over the past two years, necessitating interventions to defuse the difficulty bomb and postpone its forced obsolescence of proof of work.\n\n\nIn general, a PoS algorithm works as follows. The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum’s case, ether) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ether into a deposit. The validators take turns proposing and voting on the next valid block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e., stake). Importantly, a validator risks losing their deposit if the block they staked it on is rejected by the majority of validators. Conversely, validators earn a small reward, proportional to their deposited stake, for every block that is accepted by the majority. Thus, PoS forces validators to act honestly and follow the consensus rules, by a system of reward and punishment. The major difference between PoS and PoW is that the punishment in PoS is intrinsic to the blockchain (e.g., loss of staked ether), whereas in PoW the punishment is extrinsic (e.g., loss of funds spent on electricity).\n\n\n\nEthash: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work Algorithm\n\nEthash is the Ethereum PoW algorithm. It uses an evolution of the Dagger–Hashimoto algorithm, which is a combination of Vitalik Buterin’s Dagger algorithm and Thaddeus Dryja’s Hashimoto algorithm. Ethash is dependent on the generation and analysis of a large dataset, known as a directed acyclic graph (or, more simply, “the DAG”). The DAG had an initial size of about 1 GB and will continue to slowly and linearly grow in size, being updated once every epoch (30,000 blocks, or roughly 125 hours).\n\n\nThe purpose of the DAG is to make the Ethash PoW algorithm dependent on maintaining a large, frequently accessed data structure. This in turn is intended to make Ethash \"ASIC resistant,\" which means that it is more difficult to make application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) mining equipment that is orders of magnitude faster than a fast graphics processing unit (GPU). Ethereum’s founders wanted to avoid centralization in PoW mining, where those with access to specialized silicon fabrication factories and big budgets could dominate the mining infrastructure and undermine the security of the consensus algorithm.\n\n\nUse of consumer-level GPUs for carrying out the PoW on the Ethereum network means that more people around the world can participate in the mining process. The more independent miners there are the more decentralized the mining power is, which means we can avoid a situation like in Bitcoin, where much of the mining power is concentrated in the hands of a few large industrial mining operations. The downside of the use of GPUs for mining is that it precipitated a worldwide shortage GPUs in 2017, causing their price to skyrocket and an outcry from gamers. This led to purchase restrictions at retailers, limiting buyers to one or two GPUs per customer.\n\n\nUntil recently, the threat of ASIC miners on the Ethereum network was largely nonexistent. Using ASICs for Ethereum requires the design, manufacture, and distribution of highly customized hardware. Producing them requires considerable investment of time and money. The Ethereum developers' long-expressed plans to move to a PoS consensus algorithm likely kept ASIC suppliers away from targeting the Ethereum network for a long time. As soon as Ethereum moves to PoS, ASICs designed for the PoW algorithm will be rendered useless—that is, unless miners can use them to mine other cryptocurrencies instead. The latter possibility is now a reality with a range of other Ethash-based consensus coins available, such as PIRL and Ubiq, and Ethereum Classic has pledged to remain a PoW blockchain for the foreseeable future. This means that we will likely see ASIC mining begin to become a force on the Ethereum network while is it still operating on PoW consensus.\n\n\n\nCasper: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake Algorithm\n\nCasper is the proposed name for Ethereum’s PoS consensus algorithm. It is still under active research and development and is not implemented on the Ethereum blockchain at the time of publication of this book. Casper is being developed in two competing \"flavors\":\n\n\n\n\nCasper FFG: \"The Friendly Finality Gadget\"\n\n\nCasper CBC: \"The Friendly GHOST/Correct-by-Construction\"\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Casper FFG was proposed as a hybrid PoW/PoS algorithm to be implemented as a transition to a more permanent \"pure PoS\" algorithm. But in June 2018, Vitalik Buterin, who was leading the research work on Casper FFG, decided to \"scrap\" the hybrid model in favor of a pure PoS algorithm. Now, Casper FFG and Casper CBC are both being developed in parallel. As Vitalik explains:\n\n\n\n\nThe main tradeoff between FFG and CBC is that CBC seems to have nicer theoretical properties, but FFG seems to be easier to implement.\n\n\n\n\nMore information about Casper’s history, ongoing research and future plans can be found at the following links:\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Casper (Proof of Stake)\n\n\nHistory of Casper, Part 1\n\n\nHistory of Casper, Part 2\n\n\nHistory of Casper, Part 3\n\n\nHistory of Casper, Part 4\n\n\nHistory of Casper, Part 5\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Consensus\n\nThe principles and assumptions of consensus algorithms can be more clearly understood by asking a few key questions:\n\n\n\n\nWho can change the past, and how? (This is also known as immutability.)\n\n\nWho can change the future, and how? (This is also known as finality.)\n\n\nWhat is the cost to make such changes?\n\n\nHow decentralized is the power to make such changes?\n\n\nWho will know if something has changed, and how will they know?\n\n\n\n\nConsensus algorithms are evolving rapidly, attempting to answer these questions in increasingly innovative ways.\n\n\n\nControversy and Competition\n\nAt this point you might be wondering: Why do we need so many different consensus algorithms? Which one works better? The answer to the latter question is at the center of the most exciting area of research in distributed systems of the past decade. It all boils down to what you consider \"better”—which in the context of computer science is about assumptions, goals, and the unavoidable trade-offs.\n\n\nIt is likely that no  algorithm can optimize across all dimensions of the problem of decentralized consensus. When someone suggests that one consensus algorithm is \"better\" than the others, you should start asking questions that clarify: Better at what? Immutability, finality, decentralization, cost? There is no clear answer to these questions, at least not yet. Furthermore, the design of consensus algorithms is at the center of a multi-billion-dollar industry and generates enormous controversy and heated arguments. In the end, there might not be a \"correct\" answer, just as there might be different answers for different applications.\n\n\nThe entire blockchain industry is one giant experiment where these questions will be tested under adversarial conditions, with enormous monetary value at stake. In the end, history will answer the controversy.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nEthereum’s consensus algorithm is still in flux at the time of completion of this book. In a future edition, we will likely add more detail about Casper and other related technologies as these mature and are deployed on Ethereum. This chapter represents the end of our journey, completing Mastering Ethereum. Additional reference material follows in the appendixes. Thank you for reading this book, and congratulations on reaching the end!\n\n\n\n"},"appdx-forks-history.html":{"url":"appdx-forks-history.html","title":"Appendix A: Ethereum Fork History","keywords":"","body":"\nAppendix A: Ethereum Fork History\n\n\nMost hard forks are planned as part of an upgrade roadmap and consist of updates that the community generally agrees to (i.e., there is social consensus). However, some hard forks lack consensus, which leads to multiple distinct blockchains. The events that led to the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split are one such case, and are discussed in this appendix.\n\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nEthereum Classic came to be after members of the Ethereum community implemented a time-sensitive hard fork (codenamed “DAO”). On July 20, 2016, at a block height of 1.92 million, Ethereum introduced an irregular state change via a hard fork in an effort to return approximately 3.6 million ether that had been taken from a smart contract known as The DAO. Almost everyone agreed that the ether taken had been stolen and that leaving it all in the hands of the thief would be of significant detriment to the development of the Ethereum ecosystem as well as the platform itself.\n\n\nReturning the ether to its respective owners as though The DAO had never even existed was technically easy, if rather politically controversial. A number of people in the ecosystem disagreed with this change, believing immutability should be a fundamental principle of the Ethereum blockchain without exception; they elected to continue the original chain under the moniker of Ethereum Classic. While the split itself was initially ideological, the two chains have since evolved into separate entities.\n\n\n\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Organization (The DAO)\n\nThe DAO was created by Slock.it, with the aim of providing community-based funding and governance for projects. The core idea was that proposals would be submitted, curators would manage proposals, funds would be raised from investors within the Ethereum community, and, if the projects proved successful, investors would receive a share of the profits.\n\n\nThe DAO was also one of the first experiments in an Ethereum token. Rather than funding projects directly with ether, participants would trade their ether for DAO tokens, use them to vote on project funding, and later be able to trade them back for ether.\n\n\nDAO tokens were available to purchase in a crowdsale that ran from April 5 through April 30, 2016, amassing nearly 14% of the total ether in existence, which was worth ~$150 million at the time.\n\n\n\nThe Reentrancy Bug\n\nOn June 9, 2016, developers Peter Vessenes and Chriseth reported that most Ethereum-based contracts that managed funds were potentially vulnerable to an exploit that could empty contract funds. A few days later, on June 12, Stephen Tual (cofounder of Slock.it) reported that The DAO’s code was not vulnerable to the bug described by Peter and Chriseth. Worried DAO contributors breathed a sigh of relief—until five days later, when an unknown attacker started draining The DAO using an exploit similar to the one for which the warning had been issued. Ultimately, the DAO attacker siphoned ~3.6 million ether out of The DAO.\n\n\nSimultaneously, an assemblage of volunteers calling themselves the Robin Hood Group (RHG) started using the same exploit to withdraw the remaining funds in order to save them from being stolen by the DAO attacker. On June 21, the RHG announced that they had secured about 70% of The DAO’s funds (roughly 7.2 million ether), with plans to return it to the community (which they successfully did on the ETC network, and didn’t need to do on the Ethereum network after the fork). Many thanks and commendations were given to the RHG for their quick thinking and fast actions that helped secure the bulk of the community’s ether.\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\nWhile a more detailed and thorough explanation of the bug is given by Phil Daian, the short explanation is that a crucial function in the DAO had two lines of code in the wrong order, meaning that the attacker could have requests to withdraw ether acted upon repeatedly, before the check of whether the attacker was entitled to the withdrawal was completed. This type of vulnerability is described in [reentrancy_security].\n\n\n\nAttack Flow\n\nImagine you had $100 in your bank account and you could bring your bank teller any number of withdrawal slips. The teller would give you money for each slip in order, and only after processing all the slips would they record your withdrawal. What if you brought them three slips, each requesting withdraw $100? What if you brought them three thousand?\n\n\nThe DAO attack worked like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe DAO attacker asks the DAO contract to withdraw DAO tokens (DAO).\n\n\nThe attacker asks the contract to withdraw DAO again, before the contract updates its records to show that DAO was withdrawn.\n\n\nThe attacker repeats step 2 as many times as possible.\n\n\nThe contract finally logs a single DAO withdrawal, losing track of the withdrawals that happened in the interim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DAO Hard Fork\n\nFortunately, there were several safeguards built into The DAO: notably, all withdrawal requests were subject to a 28-day delay. This gave the community a little while to discuss what to do about the exploit, because from roughly June 17–July 20 the DAO attacker would be unable to convert their DAO tokens into ether.\n\n\nSeveral developers focused on finding a viable solution, and multiple avenues were explored in this short space of time. Among them were a DAO soft fork, announced on June 24, to delay DAO withdrawals until consensus was reached, and a DAO hard fork, announced on July 15, to reverse the effects of the DAO attack with an exceptional state change.\n\n\nOn June 28, developers discovered a DoS exploit in the DAO soft fork  and concluded that the DAO hard fork would be the only viable option to fully resolve the situation. The DAO hard fork would transfer all ether that had been invested in The DAO into a new refund smart contract, allowing the original owners of the ether to claim full refunds. This provided a solution for returning the hacked funds, but also meant interfering with the balances of specific addresses on the network, however isolated they were. There would also be some leftover ether in portions of The DAO known as childDAOs. A group of trustees would manually authorize the leftover ether, worth ~$6–7 million at the time.\n\n\nWith time running out, multiple Ethereum development teams created clients that allowed a user to decide whether they wanted to enable this fork. However, the client creators wanted to decide whether to make this choice opt-in (don’t fork by default) or opt-out (fork by default). On July 15, a vote was opened on carbonvote.com. The next day, at block height 1,894,000, it was closed. Of the 5.5% of the total ether supply that voted, ~80% of the votes (~4.5% of the total ether supply) voted for opt-out. One-quarter of the opt-out vote came from a single address.\n\n\nUltimately the decision became opt-out, so those who opposed the DAO hard fork would need to explicitly state their opposition by changing a configuration option in the software they were running.\n\n\nOn July 20, at block height 1,920,000, Ethereum implemented the DAO hard fork and thus two Ethereum networks were created: one including the state change, and the other ignoring it.\n\n\nWhen the DAO hard-forked Ethereum (present-day Ethereum) gained a majority of the mining power, many assumed that consensus was achieved and the minority chain would fade away, as in previous forks. Despite this, a sizable portion of the Ethereum community (roughly 10% by value and mining power) started supporting the non-forked chain, which came to be known as Ethereum Classic.\n\n\nWithin days of the fork, several exchanges began to list both Ethereum (\"ETH\") and Ethereum Classic (\"ETC\"). Due to the nature of hard forks, all Ethereum users holding ether at the time of the split then held funds on both of the chains, and a market value for ETC was soon established with Poloniex listing ETC on July 24.\n\n\nTimeline of the DAO Hard Fork\n\n\n\nApril 5, 2016: Slock.it creates The DAO following a security audit by Dejavu Security.\n\n\nApril 30, 2016: The DAO crowdsale launches.\n\n\nMay 27, 2016: The DAO crowdsale ends.\n\n\nJune 9, 2016: A generic recursive call bug is discovered and believed to affect many Solidity contracts that track users' balances.\n\n\nJune 12, 2016: Stephen Tual declares that The DAO’s funds are not at risk.\n\n\nJune 17, 2016: The DAO is exploited and a variant of the discovered bug (termed the \"reentrancy bug\") is used to start draining the funds, eventually nabbing ~30% of the ether.\n\n\nJune 21, 2016: The RHG announces it has secured the other ~70% of the ether stored within The DAO.\n\n\nJune 24, 2016: A soft fork vote is announced via opt-in signaling through Geth and Parity clients, designed to temporarily withhold funds until the community can better decide what to do.\n\n\nJune 28, 2016: A vulnerability is discovered in the soft fork and it’s abandoned.\n\n\nJune 28, 2016 to July 15: Users debate whether or not to hard fork; most of the vocal public debate occurs on the /r/ethereum subreddit.\n\n\nJuly 15, 2016: The DAO hard fork is proposed, to return the funds taken in the DAO attack.\n\n\nJuly 15, 2016: A vote is held on CarbonVote to decide if the DAO hard fork will be opt-in (don’t fork by default) or opt-out (fork by default).\n\n\nJuly 16, 2016: 5.5% of the total ether supply votes; ~80% of the votes (~4.5% of the total supply) are pro the opt-out hard fork, with one-quarter of the pro-vote coming from a single address.\n\n\nJuly 20, 2016: The hard fork occurs at block 1,920,000.\n\n\nJuly 20, 2016: Those against the DAO hard fork continue running the old client software; this leads to issues with transactions being replayed on both chains.\n\n\nJuly 24, 2016: Poloniex lists the original Ethereum chain under the ticker symbol ETC; it’s the first exchange to do so.\n\n\nAugust 10, 2016: The RHG transfers 2.9 million of the recovered ETC to Poloniex in order to convert it to ETH on the advice of Bity SA; 14% of the total RHG holdings are converted from ETC to ETH and other cryptocurrencies, and Poloniex freezes the other 86% of deposited ETH.\n\n\nAugust 30, 2016: The frozen funds are sent by Poloniex back to the RHG, which then sets up a refund contract on the ETC chain.\n\n\nDecember 11, 2016: IOHK’s ETC development team forms, led by Ethereum founding member Charles Hoskinson.\n\n\nJanuary 13, 2017: The ETC network is updated to resolve transaction replay issues; the chains are now functionally separate.\n\n\nFebruary 20, 2017: The ETCDEVTeam forms, led by early ETC developer Igor Artamonov (splix).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum and Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile the initial split was centered around The DAO, the two networks, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, are now separate projects, although most development is still done by the Ethereum community and simply ported to Ethereum Classic codebases. Nevertheless, the full set of differences is constantly evolving and too extensive to cover in this appendix. However, it is worth noting that the chains do differ significantly in their core development and community structure. A few of the technical differences are discussed next.\n\n\nThe EVM\n\nFor the most part (at the time of writing), the two networks remain highly compatible: contract code produced for one chain runs as expected on the other; but there are some small differences in EVM OPCODES (see EIPs 140, 145, and 214).\n\n\n\nCore Network Development\n\nBeing open projects, blockchain platforms often have many users and contributors. However, the core network development (i.e., of the code that runs the network) is often done by small groups due to the expertise and knowledge required to develop this type of software. On Ethereum, this work is done by the Ethereum Foundation and volunteers. On Ethereum Classic, it’s done by ETCDEV, IOHK, and volunteers.\n\n\n\n\nOther Notable Ethereum Forks\n\nEllaism is an Ethereum-based network that intends to use PoW exclusively to secure the blockchain. It has no pre-mine and no mandatory developer fees, with all support and development donated freely by the community. Its developers believe this makes theirs “one of the most honest pure Ethereum projects,” and one that is “uniquely interesting as a platform for serious developers, educators, and enthusiasts. Ellaism is a pure smart contract platform. Its goal is to create a smart contract platform that is both fair and trustworthy.” The principles of the platform are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll changes and upgrades to the protocol should strive to maintain and reinforce these Principles of Ellaism.\n\n\nMonetary Policy: 280 million coins.\n\n\nNo Censorship: Nobody should be able to prevent valid txs from being confirmed.\n\n\nOpen-Source: Ellaism source code should always be open for anyone to read, modify, copy, share.\n\n\nPermissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc).\n\n\nPseudonymous: No ID should be required to own, use Ellaism.\n\n\nFungible: All coins are equal and should be equally spendable.\n\n\nIrreversible Transactions: Confirmed blocks should be set in stone. Blockchain History should be immutable.\n\n\nNo Contentious Hard Forks: Never hard fork without consensus from the whole community. Only break the existing consensus when necessary.\n\n\nMany feature upgrades can be carried out without a hard fork, such as improving the performance of the EVM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other forks have occurred on Ethereum as well. Some of these are hard forks, in the sense that they split directly off of the preexisting Ethereum network. Others are software forks: they use Ethereum’s client/node software but run entirely separate networks without any history shared with Ethereum. There will likely be more forks over the life of Ethereum.\n\n\nThere are also several other projects that claim to be Ethereum forks but are actually based on ERC20 tokens and run on the Ethereum network. Two examples of these are EtherBTC (ETHB) and Ethereum Modification (EMOD). These are not forks in the traditional sense, and may sometimes be called “airdrops.”\n\n\nHere’s a brief rundown of some of the more notable forks that have occurred:\n\n\n\n\nExpanse was the first fork of the Ethereum blockchain to gain traction. It was announced via the Bitcoin Talk forum on September 7, 2015. The actual fork occurred a week later on September 14, 2015, at a block height of 800,000. It was originally founded by Christopher Franko and James Clayton. Their stated vision was to create an advanced chain for: \"identity, governance, charity, commerce, and equity\".\n\n\nEthereumFog (ETF) was launched on December 14, 2017, and forked at a block height of 4,730,660. The project’s stated aim is to develop \"world decentralized fog computing\" by focusing on fog computing and decentralized storage. There is still little information on what this will actually entail.\n\n\nEtherZero (ETZ) was launched on January 19, 2018, at a block height of 4,936,270. Its notable innovations were the introduction of a masternode architecture and the removal of transaction fees for smart contracts to enable a wider diversity of DApps. There has been some criticism from some prominent members of the Ethereum community, MyEtherWallet, and MetaMask, due to the lack of clarity surrounding development and some accusations of possible phishing.\n\n\nEtherInc (ETI) was launched on February 13, 2018, at a block height of 5,078,585, with a focus on building decentralized organizations. Stated goals include the reduction of block times, increased miner rewards, the removal of uncle rewards, and setting a cap on mineable coins. EtherInc uses the same private keys as Ethereum and has implemented replay protection to protect ether on the original non-forked chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"appdx-standards-eip-erc.html":{"url":"appdx-standards-eip-erc.html","title":"Appendix A: Ethereum Standards","keywords":"","body":"\nAppendix A: Ethereum Standards\n\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nThe Ethereum Improvement Proposal repository is located at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/.

By doing everything yourself you get a better understanding of how everything fits together, but it’s a lot of tedious, repetitive work. The frameworks described in this section can automate certain tasks and make development easier.\n\n\nTruffle\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle\n\n\nWebsite: https://truffleframework.com\n\n\nDocumentation: https://truffleframework.com/docs\n\n\nTruffle Boxes: http://truffleframework.com/boxes/\n\n\nnpm package repository: https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle\n\n\nInstalling the Truffle framework\n\nThe Truffle framework comprises several Node.js packages. Before you install truffle, you need to have an up-to-date and working installation of Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm).\n\n\nThe recommended way to install Node.js and npm is to use the Node Version Manager (nvm). Once you install nvm, it will handle all the dependencies and updates for you. Follow the instructions found at http://nvm.sh.\n\n\nOnce nvm is installed on your operating system, installing Node.js is simple. Use the --lts flag to tell nvm that you want the most recent “long-term support” (LTS) version of Node.js:\n\n\n$ nvm install --lts\n\n\nConfirm you have node and npm installed:\n\n\n$ node -v\nv8.9.4\n$ npm -v\n5.6.0\n\n\nNext, create a hidden file, .nvmrc, that contains the Node.js version supported by your DApp so developers just need to run nvm install in the root of the project directory and it will automatically install and switch to using that version:\n\n\n$ node -v > .nvmrc\n$ nvm install\n\n\nLooking good. Now to install truffle:\n\n\n$ npm -g install truffle\n\n+ truffle@4.0.6\ninstalled 1 package in 37.508s\n\n\n\nIntegrating a prebuilt Truffle project (Truffle Box)\n\nIf you want to use or create a DApp that builds upon prebuilt boilerplate, go to the Truffle Boxes website, choose an existing Truffle project, and then run the following command to download and extract it:\n\n\n$ truffle unbox BOX_NAME\n\n\n\nCreating a truffle project directory\n\nFor each project where you will use truffle, create a project directory and initialize truffle within that directory. truffle will create the necessary directory structure inside your project directory. It’s customary to give the project directory a name that describes the project. For this example, we will use truffle to deploy our Faucet contract from [simple_contract_example], and therefore we will name the project folder Faucet:\n\n\n$ mkdir Faucet\n$ cd Faucet\nFaucet $\n\n\nOnce inside the Faucet directory, we initialize truffle:\n\n\nFaucet $ truffle init\n\n\ntruffle creates a directory structure and some default files:\n\n\n\nFaucet\n+---- contracts\n|   `---- Migrations.sol\n+---- migrations\n|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js\n+---- test\n+---- truffle-config.js\n`---- truffle.js\n\n\n\nWe will also use a number of JavaScript (Node.js) support packages, in addition to truffle itself. We can install these with npm. We initialize the npm directory structure and accept the defaults suggested by npm:\n\n\n$ npm init\n\npackage name: (faucet)\nversion: (1.0.0)\ndescription:\nentry point: (truffle-config.js)\ntest command:\ngit repository:\nkeywords:\nauthor:\nlicense: (ISC)\nAbout to write to Faucet/package.json:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"faucet\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"truffle-config.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"test\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\"\n}\n\n\nIs this ok? (yes)\n\n\nNow, we can install the dependencies that we will use to make working with truffle easier:\n\n\n$ npm install dotenv truffle-wallet-provider ethereumjs-wallet\n\n\nWe now have a node_modules directory with several thousand files inside our Faucet directory.\n\n\nPrior to deploying a DApp to a cloud production or continuous integration environment, it is important to specify the engines field so that your DApp is built with the correct Node.js version and its associated dependencies are installed. For details on configuring this field, see the documentation.\n\n\n\nConfiguring truffle\n\ntruffle creates some empty configuration files, truffle.js and truffle-config.js. On Windows systems the truffle.js name may cause a conflict when you try to run the command truffle and Windows attempts to run truffle.js instead. To avoid this, we will delete truffle.js and use truffle-config.js (in support of Windows users, who, honestly, suffer enough already):\n\n\n$ rm truffle.js\n\n\nNow we edit truffle-config.js and replace the contents with the sample configuation shown here:\n\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  networks: {\n    localnode: { // Whatever network our local node connects to\n      network_id: \"*\", // Match any network ID\n      host: \"localhost\",\n      port: 8545,\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\nThis configuration is a good starting point. It sets up one default Ethereum network (named localnode), which assumes we are running an Ethereum client such as Parity, either as a full node or as a light client. This configuration will instruct truffle to communicate with the local node over RPC, on port 8545. truffle will use whatever Ethereum network the local node is connected to, such as the Ethereum main network, or a test network like Ropsten. The local node will also be providing the wallet functionality.\n\n\nIn following sections, we will configure additional networks for truffle to use, such as the ganache local test blockchain and Infura, a hosted network provider. As we add more networks, the configuration file will get more complex, but it will also give us more options for our testing and development workflow.\n\n\n\nUsing truffle to deploy a contract\n\nWe now have a basic working directory for our Faucet project, and we have truffle and its dependencies configured. Contracts go in the contracts subdirectory of our project. The directory already contains a \"helper\" contract, Migrations.sol, which manages contract upgrades for us. We’ll examine the use of Migrations.sol in the next section.\n\n\nLet’s copy the Faucet.sol contract (from [solidity_faucet_example]) into the contracts subdirectory, so that the project directory looks like this:\n\n\n\nFaucet\n+---- contracts\n|   +---- Faucet.sol\n|   `---- Migrations.sol\n...\n\n\n\nWe can now ask truffle to compile the contract for us:\n\n\n$ truffle compile\nCompiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...\nCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...\nWriting artifacts to ./build/contracts\n\n\n\nTruffle migrations—understanding deployment scripts\n\nTruffle offers a deployment system called a migration. If you have worked in other frameworks, you may have seen something similar: Ruby on Rails, Python Django, and many other languages and frameworks have a migrate command.\n\n\nIn all those frameworks, the purpose of a migration is to handle changes in the data schema between different versions of the software. The purpose of migrations in Ethereum is slightly different. Because Ethereum contracts are immutable and cost gas to deploy, Truffle offers a migration mechanism to keep track of which contracts (and which versions) have already been deployed. In a complex project with dozens of contracts and complex dependencies, you would not want to have to pay to redeploy contracts that haven’t changed. You would also not want to manually track which versions of which contracts have been deployed already. The Truffle migration mechanism does all that by deploying the smart contract Migrations.sol, which then keeps track of all other contract deployments.\n\n\nWe have only one contract, Faucet.sol, which means that the migration system is overkill, to say the least. Unfortunately, we have to use it. But, by learning how to use it for one contract, we can start practicing some good habits for our development workflow. The effort will pay off as things get more complicated.\n\n\nTruffle’s migrations directory is where the migration scripts are found. Right now there’s only one script, 1_initial_migration.js, which deploys the Migrations.sol contract itself:\n\n\n\nlink:code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/1_initial_migration.js[]\n\n\n\nWe need a second migration script, to deploy Faucet.sol. Let’s call it 2_deploy_contracts.js. It is very simple, just like 1_initial_migration.js, with only a few small changes. In fact, you can copy the contents of 1_initial_migration.j and simply replace all instances of Migrations with Faucet:\n\n\n\nlink:code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]\n\n\n\nThe script initializes a variable Faucet, identifying the Faucet.sol Solidity source code as the artifact that defines Faucet. Then it calls the deploy function to deploy this contract.\n\n\nWe’re all set. Let’s use truffle migrate to deploy it on. We have to specify which network to deploy the contract, using the --network argument. We only have one network specified in the configuration file, which we named localnode. Make sure your local Ethereum client is running and then type:\n\n\nFaucet $ truffle migrate --network localnode\n\n\nBecause we are using a local node to connect to the Ethereum network and manage our wallet, we have to authorize the transaction that truffle creates. We’re running parity connected to the Ropsten test blockchain, so during the migration we’ll see a pop-up like the one in Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet on Parity’s web console.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet\n\n\nThere are four transactions in total: one to deploy Migrations, one to update the deployments counter to 1, one to deploy Faucet, and one to update the deployments counter to 2.\n\n\nTruffle will show the migrations completing, show each of the transactions, and show the contract addresses:\n\n\n$ truffle migrate --network localnode\nUsing network 'localnode'.\n\nRunning migration: 1_initial_migration.js\n  Deploying Migrations...\n  ... 0xfa090db179d023d2abae543b4a21a1479e70ca7d35a469a5d1a98bfc6bd80fe8\n  Migrations: 0x8861c27715550bed8362c0345add158489df6db0\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0x985c4a32716826ddbe4eae284104bef8bc69e959899f62246a1b27c9dfcd6c03\nSaving artifacts...\nRunning migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js\n  Deploying Faucet...\n  ... 0xecdbeef77f0558edc689440e34b7bba0a3ba7a45e4b680b071b47c30a930e9d6\n  Faucet: 0xd01cd8e7bd29e4bff8c1693f59eee46137a9f300\nSaving successful migration to network...\n  ... 0x11f376bd7307edddfd40dc4a14c3f7cb84b6c921ac2465602060b67d08f9fd8a\nSaving artifacts...\n\n\n\nUsing the Truffle console\n\nTruffle offers a JavaScript console that we can use to interact with the Ethereum network (via the local node), interact with deployed contracts, and interact with the wallet provider. In our current configuration (localnode), the node and wallet provider is our local Parity client.\n\n\nLet’s start the Truffle console and try some commands:\n\n\n$ truffle console --network localnode\ntruffle(localnode)>\n\n\nTruffle presents a prompt, showing the selected network configuration (localnode).\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s important to remember and be aware of which network you are using. You wouldn’t want to accidentally deploy a test contract or make a transaction on the Ethereum main network. That could be an expensive mistake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Truffle console offers an autocomplete function that makes it easy for us to explore the environment. If we press Tab after a partially completed command, Truffle will complete the command for us. Pressing Tab twice will show all possible completions if more than one command matches our input. In fact, if we press Tab twice on an empty prompt, Truffle lists all the available commands:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)>\nArray Boolean Date Error EvalError Function Infinity JSON Math NaN Number Object RangeError ReferenceError RegExp String SyntaxError TypeError URIError decodeURI decodeURIComponent encodeURI encodeURIComponent eval isFinite isNaN parseFloat parseInt undefined\n\nArrayBuffer Buffer DataView Faucet Float32Array Float64Array GLOBAL Int16Array Int32Array Int8Array Intl Map Migrations Promise Proxy Reflect Set StateManager Symbol Uint16Array Uint32Array Uint8Array Uint8ClampedArray WeakMap WeakSet WebAssembly XMLHttpRequest _ assert async_hooks buffer child_process clearImmediate clearInterval clearTimeout cluster console crypto dgram dns domain escape events fs global http http2 https module net os path perf_hooks process punycode querystring readline repl require root setImmediate setInterval setTimeout stream string_decoder tls tty unescape url util v8 vm web3 zlib\n\n__defineGetter__ __defineSetter__ __lookupGetter__ __lookupSetter__ __proto__ constructor hasOwnProperty isPrototypeOf propertyIsEnumerable toLocaleString toString valueOf\n\n\nThe vast majority of the wallet- and node-related functions are provided by the web3 object, which is an instance of the web3.js library. The web3 object abstracts the RPC interface to our Parity node. You will also notice two objects with familiar names: Migrations and Faucet. Those represent the contracts we just deployed. We will use the Truffle console to interact with a contract. First, let’s check our wallet via the web3 object:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.accounts\n[ '0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f',\n  '0xdb5dc1a13e3a55cf3b4587cd8d1e5fdeb6738145' ]\n\n\nOur Parity client has two wallets, with some test ether on Ropsten. The web3.eth.accounts attribute contains a list of all the accounts. We can check the balance of the first account using the getBalance function:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber()\n191198572800000000\ntruffle(localnode)>\n\n\nweb3.js is a large JavaScript library that offers a comprehensive interface to the Ethereum system, via a provider such as a local client. We will examine web3.js in more detail in [web3js_tutorial]. Now let’s try to interact with our contracts:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> Faucet.address\n'0xd01cd8e7bd29e4bff8c1693f59eee46137a9f300'\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()\n0\ntruffle(localnode)>\n\n\nNext, we’ll use sendTransaction to send some test ether to fund the Faucet contract. Note the use of web3.toWei to convert ether units for us. Typing 18 zeros without making a mistake is both difficult and dangerous, so it’s always better to use a unit converter for values. Here’s how we send the transaction:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:web3.eth.accounts[0],\n                    to:Faucet.address, value:web3.toWei(0.5, 'ether')});\n'0xf134c75b985dc0e0c27c2f0412251e0860eb530a5055e660f21e7483ab336808'\n\n\nIf we switch to the Parity web interface, we’ll see a pop-up asking us to confirm this transaction. Once the transaction is mined, we’ll be able to see the balance of our Faucet contract:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()\n500000000000000000\n\n\nLet’s call the withdraw function now, to withdraw some test ether from the contract:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> Faucet.deployed().then(instance =>\n                       {instance.withdraw(web3.toWei(0.1,\n                       'ether'))}).then(console.log)\n\n\nAgain, we’ll need to approve the transaction in the Parity web interface. If we check again we’ll see that the balance of the Faucet contract has decreased, and our test wallet has received 0.1 ether:\n\n\ntruffle(localnode)> web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()\n400000000000000000\ntruffle(localnode)> Faucet.deployed().then(instance =>\n                    {instance.withdraw(web3.toWei(1, 'ether'))})\nStatusError: Transaction: 0xe147ae9e3610334...8612b92d3f9c\n  exited with an error (status 0).\n\n\n\n\nEmbark\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/embark-framework/embark/\n\n\nDocumentation: https://embark.status.im/docs/\n\n\nnpm package repository: https://www.npmjs.com/package/embark\n\n\nEmbark is a framework built to allow developers to easily develop and deploy decentralized applications.\nEmbark integrates with Ethereum, IPFS, Whisper, and Swarm to offer the following features:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically deploy contracts and make them available in JS code.\n\n\nWatch for changes and update contracts to redeploy if needed.\n\n\nManage and interact with different chains (e.g., testnet, local, mainnet).\n\n\nManage complex systems of interdependent contracts.\n\n\nStore and retrieve data, including uploading and retrieving files hosted in IPFS.\n\n\nEase the process of deploying the full application to IPFS or Swarm.\n\n\nSend and receive messages through Whisper.\n\n\n\n\nYou can install it with npm:\n\n\n$ npm -g install embark\n\n\n\nOpenZeppelin\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity\n\n\nWebsite: https://openzeppelin.org/\n\n\nDocumentation: https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/open-zeppelin.html\n\n\nOpenZeppelin is an open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.\n\n\nIt is community-driven, led by the Zeppelin team, with over a hundred external contributors. The main focus of the framework is security, achieved by applying industry-standard contract security patterns and best practices, drawing on all the experience the Zeppelin devs have gained from auditing a huge number of contracts, and through constant testing and auditing from the community that uses the framework as a base for their real-world applications.\n\n\nThe OpenZeppelin framework is the most widely used solution for Ethereum smart contracts. The framework currently has an ample library of contracts including implementations of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, many flavors of crowdsale models, and simple behaviors commonly found in contracts such as Ownable, Pausable, or LimitBalance. The contracts in this repository in some cases function as de facto standard implementations.\n\n\nThe framework is licensed under an MIT license, and all the contracts have been designed with a modular approach to guarantee ease of reuse and extension. These are clean and basic building blocks, ready to be used in your next Ethereum project. Let’s set up the framework and build a simple crowdsale using the OpenZeppelin contracts, to demonstrate how easy it is to use. This example also stresses the importance of reusing secure components instead of writing them by yourself.\n\n\nFirst, we will need to install the openzeppelin-solidity library into our workspace. The latest release as of the time of this writing is v1.9.0, so we will use that one:\n\n\n$ mkdir sample-crowdsale\n$ cd sample-crowdsale\n$ npm install openzeppelin-solidity@1.9.0\n$ mkdir contracts\n\n\nAt the time of writing, OpenZeppelin includes multiple basic token contracts that follow the ERC20, ERC721, and ERC827 standards, with different characteristics for emission, limits, vesting, life cycle, etc.\n\n\nLet’s make an ERC20 token that’s mintable, meaning that the initial supply starts at 0 and new tokens can be created by the token owner (in our case, the crowdsale contract) and sold to buyers. In order to do this, we’ll create a contracts/SampleToken.sol file with the following contents:\n\n\n\nlink:code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleToken.sol[]\n\n\n\nOpenZeppelin already provides a MintableToken contract that we can use as a base for our token, so we only define the details that are specific to our case. Next, let’s make the crowdsale contract. Just like with tokens, OpenZeppelin already provides a wide variety of crowdsale flavors. Currently, you will find contracts for various scenarios involving distribution, emission, price, and validation. So, let’s say that you want to set a goal for your crowdsale and if it’s not met by the time the sale finishes, you want to refund all your investors. For that, you can use the RefundableCrowdsale contract. Or maybe you want to define a crowdsale with an increasing price to incentivize early buyers; there is an IncreasingPriceCrowdsale contract just for that. You can also end the crowdsale when a specified amount of ether has been received by the contract (CappedCrowdsale), or set a finishing time with the TimedCrowdsale contract, or create a whitelist of buyers with the WhitelistedCrowdsale contract.\n\n\nAs we said before, the OpenZeppelin contracts are basic building blocks. These crowdsale contracts have been designed to be combined; just read the source code of the base Crowdsale contract for directions on how to extend it. For the crowdsale of our token, we need to mint tokens when ether is received by the crowdsale contract, so let’s use MintedCrowdsale as a base. And to make it more interesting, let’s also make it a PostDeliveryCrowdsale so the tokens can only be withdrawn after the crowdsale ends. To do this, we’ll write the following into contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol:\n\n\n\nlink:code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol[]\n\n\n\nAgain, we barely had to write any code; we just reused the battle-tested code that the OpenZeppelin community made available. However, it is important to note that this case is different than that of our SampleToken contract. If you go to the Crowdsale automated tests you will see that they are tested in isolation. When you integrate different units of code into a bigger component, it’s not enough to test all the units separately, because the interactions between them might cause behaviors that you didn’t expect. In particular, you will see that here we introduced multiple inheritance, which can surprise the developer if they don’t understand the details of Solidity. Our SampleCrowdsale contract is simple, and it will work just as we expect because the framework was designed to make cases like these straightforward; but do not relax your vigilance because of the simplicity that this framework introduces. Every time you integrate parts of the OpenZeppelin framework to build a more complex solution, you must fully test every aspect of your solution to ensure that all the interactions of the units work as you intend.\n\n\nFinally, when we are happy with our solution and have tested it thoroughly, we need to deploy it. OpenZeppelin integrates well with Truffle, so we can just write a migrations file like the following (migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js), as explained in Truffle migrations—understanding deployment scripts:\n\n\n\nlink:code/OpenZeppelin/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis was just a quick overview of a few of the contracts that are part of the OpenZeppelin framework. You are welcome to join the OpenZeppelin development community to learn and contribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeppelinOS\n\nGitHhub: https://github.com/zeppelinos\n\n\nWebsite: https://zeppelinos.org\n\n\nBlog: https://blog.zeppelinos.org\n\n\nZeppelinOS is “an open source, distributed platform of tools and services on top of the EVM\nto develop and manage smart contract applications securely.”\n\n\nUnlike OpenZeppelin’s code, which needs to be redeployed with each application every time it’s used, ZeppelinOS’s code lives on-chain. Applications that need a given functionality—say, an ERC20 token—not only do not have to redesign and reaudit its implementation (something that OpenZeppelin solved) but do not even need to deploy it. With ZeppelinOS, an application interacts with the token’s on-chain implementation directly, in much the same way as a desktop application interacts with the components of its underlying OS.\n\n\nAt the core of ZeppelinOS sits a very clever contract known as a proxy. A proxy is a contract that is capable of wrapping any other contract, exposing its interface without having to manually implement setters and getters for it, and can upgrade it without losing state. In Solidity terms, it can be seen as a normal contract whose business logic is contained within a library, which can be swapped for a new library at any time without losing its state. The way in which the proxy links to its implementation is completely automated and encapsulated for the developer. Practically any contract can be made upgradeable with little to no change in its code. More about ZeppelinOS’s proxy mechanism can be found in the  blog, and an example of how to use it can be found on GitHub.\n\n\nDeveloping applications using ZeppelinOS is similar to developing JavaScript applications using npm. An AppManager handles an application package for each version of the application. A package is simply a directory of contracts, each of which can have one or more upgradeable proxies. The AppManager not only provides proxies for application-specific contracts, but also does so for ZeppelinOS implementations, in the form of a standard library. To see a full example of this, please visit examples/complex.\n\n\nAlthough currently in development, ZeppelinOS aims to provide a wide set of additional features, such as developer tools, a scheduler that automates background operations within contracts, development bounties, a marketplace that facilitates communication and exchange of value between applications, and much more. All of this is described in ZeppelinOS’s whitepaper.\n\n\n\n\nUtilities\n\nEthereumJS helpeth: A Command-Line Utility\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/ethereumjs/helpeth\n\n\nhelpeth is a command-line tool for key and transaction manipulation that makes a developer’s job a lot easier.\n\n\nIt is part of the EthereumJS collection of JavaScript-based libraries and tools:\n\n\n\nUsage: helpeth [command]\n\nCommands:\n  signMessage                      Sign a message\n  verifySig                      Verify signature\n  verifySigParams            Verify signature parameters\n  createTx          Sign a transaction\n   \n  assembleTx        Assemble a transaction from its\n               components\n  parseTx                               Parse raw transaction\n  keyGenerate [format] [icapdirect]         Generate new key\n  keyConvert                                Convert a key to V3 keystore format\n  keyDetails                                Print key details\n  bip32Details                        Print key details for a given path\n  addressDetails                   Print details about an address\n  unitConvert              Convert between Ethereum units\n\nOptions:\n  -p, --private      Private key as a hex string                        [string]\n  --password         Password for the private key                       [string]\n  --password-prompt  Prompt for the private key password               [boolean]\n  -k, --keyfile      Encoded key file                                   [string]\n  --show-private     Show private key details                          [boolean]\n  --mnemonic         Mnemonic for HD key derivation                     [string]\n  --version          Show version number                               [boolean]\n  --help             Show help                                         [boolean]\n\n\n\n\ndapp.tools\n\nWebsite: https://dapp.tools/\n\n\ndapp.tools is a comprehensive suite of blockchain-oriented developer tools created in the spirit of the Unix philosophy.

These tests are run against Ganache.\n\nEmbark\n\nEmbark integrates with Mocha to run unit tests written in JavaScript. The tests are in turn run against contracts deployed on TestRPC/Ganache. The Embark framework automatically deploys smart contracts, and will automatically redeploy the contracts when they are changed. It also keeps track of deployed contracts and deploys contracts only when truly needed. Embark includes a testing library to rapidly run and test your contracts in an EVM, with functions like assert.equal. The command embark test will run any test files under the directory test.\n\nDapp\n\nDapp uses native Solidity code (a library called ds-test) and a Parity-built Rust library called ethrun to execute Ethereum bytecode and then assert correctness. The ds-test library provides assertion functions for validating correctness and events for logging data in the console.\n\nThe assertion functions include:\n\n\n\nassert(bool condition)\nassertEq(address a, address b)\nassertEq(bytes32 a, bytes32 b)\nassertEq(int a, int b)\nassertEq(uint a, uint b)\nassertEq0(bytes a, bytes b)\nexpectEventsExact(address target)\n\n\n\nThe logging commands will log information to the console, making them useful for debugging:\n\n\n\nlogs(bytes)\nlog_bytes32(bytes32)\nlog_named_bytes32(bytes32 key, bytes32 val)\nlog_named_address(bytes32 key, address val)\nlog_named_int(bytes32 key, int val)\nlog_named_uint(bytes32 key, uint val)\nlog_named_decimal_int(bytes32 key, int val, uint decimals)\nlog_named_decimal_uint(bytes32 key, uint val, uint decimals)\n\n\n\nPopulus\n\nPopulus uses Python and its own chain emulator to run contracts written in Solidity. Unit tests are written in Python with the pytest library. Populus supports writing contracts specifically for testing. These contract filenames should match the glob pattern Test*.sol and be located anywhere under the project tests directory, tests.\n\n\n\n\nOn-Blockchain Testing\n\nAlthough most testing shouldn’t occur on deployed contracts, a contract’s behavior can be checked via Ethereum clients.  The following commands can be used to assess a smart contract’s state. These commands should be typed at the geth terminal, although any web3 console will also support them.\n\n\nTo get the address of a contract at txhash, use:\n\n\neth.getTransactionReceipt(txhash);\n\n\nThis command gets the code of a contract deployed at contractaddress; this can be used to verify proper deployment:\n\n\neth.getCode(contractaddress)\n\n\nThis gets the full logs of the contract located at the address specified in options, which is helpful for viewing the history of a contract’s calls:\n\n\neth.getPastLogs(options)\n\n\nFinally, this command gets the storage located at address with an offset of position:\n\n\neth.getStorageAt(address, position)\n\n\n\nGanache: A Local Test Blockchain\n\nGanache is a local test blockchain that you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as a desktop application (with a graphical user interface) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also available as a command-line utility called ganache-cli. For more details and installation instructions for the Ganache desktop application, see https://truffleframework.com/ganache.\n\n\nThe ganache-cli code can be found at https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/.\n\n\nTo install the command line ganache-cli, use npm:\n\n\n$ npm install -g ganache-cli\n\n\nYou can use ganache-cli to start a local blockchain for testing as follows:\n\n\n$ ganache-cli \\\n  --networkId=3 \\\n  --port=\"8545\" \\\n  --verbose \\\n  --gasLimit=8000000 \\\n  --gasPrice=4000000000;\n\n\nA few notes on this command line:\n\n\n\n\n❏ Check the --networkId and --port flag values match your configuration in truffle.js.\n\n\n❏ Check the --gasLimit flag value matches the latest mainnet gas limit (e.g., 8,000,000 gas) shown at https://ethstats.net to avoid encountering “out of gas” exceptions unnecessarily. Note that a --gasPrice of 4000000000 represents a gas price of 4 gwei.\n\n\n❏ You can optionally enter a --mnemonic flag value to restore a previous HD wallet and associated addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"appdx-web3js-tutorial.html":{"url":"appdx-web3js-tutorial.html","title":"Appendix A: web3.js Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"\nAppendix A: web3.js Tutorial\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis tutorial is based on web3@1.0.0-beta.29 web3.js. It is intended as an introduction to web3.js.\n\n\nThe web3.js JavaScript library is a collection of modules that contain specific functionality for the Ethereum ecosystem, together with an Ethereum-compatible JavaScript API that implements the Generic JSON RPC spec.\n\n\nTo run this script you don’t need to run your own local node, because it uses the Infura services.\n\n\n\nweb3.js Contract Basic Interaction in a Nonblocked (Async) Fashion\n\nCheck you have a valid npm version:\n\n\n$ npm -v\n5.6.0\n\n\nIf you haven’t, initialize npm:\n\n\n$ npm init\n\n\nInstall basic dependencies:\n\n\n$ npm i command-line-args\n$ npm i web3\n$ npm i node-rest-client-promise\n\n\nThis will update your package.json configuration file with your new dependencies.\n\n\nNode.js Script Execution\n\nBasic execution:\n\n\n$ node code/web3js/web3-contract-basic-interaction.js\n\n\nUse your own Infura token (register at https://infura.io/ and store the api-key in a local file called infura_token):\n\n\n$ node code/web3js/web3-contract-basic-interaction.js \\\n  --infuraFileToken /path/to/file/with/infura_token\n\n\nor:\n\n\n$ node code/web3js/web3-contract-basic-interaction.js \\\n  /path/to/file/with/infura_token\n\n\nThis will read the file with your own token and pass it in as a command-line argument to the actual command.\n\n\n\n\nReviewing the Demo Script\n\nNext, let’s review our demo script, web3-contract-basic-interaction.\n\n\nWe use the Web3 object to obtain a basic web3 provider:\n\n\n\nvar web3 = new Web3(infura_host);\n\n\n\nWe can then interact with web3 and try some basic functions. Let’s see the protocol version:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.getProtocolVersion().then(function(protocolVersion) {\n      console.log(`Protocol Version: ${protocolVersion}`);\n  })\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at the current gas price:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.getGasPrice().then(function(gasPrice) {\n      console.log(`Gas Price: ${gasPrice}`);\n  })\n\n\n\nWhat’s the last mined block in the current chain?\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(function(blockNumber) {\n      console.log(`Block Number: ${blockNumber}`);\n  })\n\n\n\n\nContract Interaction\n\nNow let’s try some basic interactions with a contract. For these examples, we’ll use the WETH9_ contract on the Kovan testnet.\n\n\nFirst, let’s initialize our contract address:\n\n\n\nvar our_contract_address = \"0xd0A1E359811322d97991E03f863a0C30C2cF029C\";\n\n\n\nWe can then look at its balance:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.getBalance(our_contract_address).then(function(balance) {\n      console.log(`Balance of ${our_contract_address}: ${balance}`);\n})\n\n\n\nand see its bytecode:\n\n\n\nweb3.eth.getCode(our_contract_address).then(function(code) {\n      console.log(code);\n})\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll prepare our environment to interact with the Etherscan explorer API.\n\n\nLet’s initialize our contract URL in the Etherscan explorer API for the Kovan chain:\n\n\n\nvar etherscan_url =\n  \"https://kovan.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getabi&\n  address=${our_contract_address}\"\n\n\n\nAnd let’s initialize a REST client to interact with the Etherscan API:\n\n\n\nvar client = require('node-rest-client-promise').Client();\n\n\n\nand get a client promise:\n\n\n\nclient.getPromise(etherscan_url)\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve got a valid client promise, we can get our contract ABI from the Etherscan API:\n\n\n\n.then((client_promise) => {\n  our_contract_abi = JSON.parse(client_promise.data.result);\n\n\n\nAnd now we can create our contract object as a promise to consume later:\n\n\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      var our_contract = new web3.eth.Contract(our_contract_abi,\n                                               our_contract_address);\n      try {\n        // If all goes well\n        resolve(our_contract);\n      } catch (ex) {\n        // If something goes wrong\n        reject(ex);\n      }\n    });\n})\n\n\n\nIf our contract promise returns successfully, we can start interacting with it:\n\n\n\n.then((our_contract) => {\n\n\n\nLet’s see our contract address:\n\n\n\nconsole.log(`Our Contract address:\n            ${our_contract._address}`);\n\n\n\nor alternatively:\n\n\n\nconsole.log(`Our Contract address in another way:\n            ${our_contract.options.address}`);\n\n\n\nNow let’s query our contract ABI:\n\n\n\nconsole.log(\"Our contract abi: \" +\n            JSON.stringify(our_contract.options.jsonInterface));\n\n\n\nWe can see our contract’s total supply using a callback:\n\n\n\nour_contract.methods.totalSupply().call(function(err, totalSupply) {\n    if (!err) {\n        console.log(`Total Supply with a callback:  ${totalSupply}`);\n    } else {\n        console.log(err);\n    }\n});\n\n\n\nOr we can use the returned promise instead of passing in the callback:\n\n\n\nour_contract.methods.totalSupply().call().then(function(totalSupply){\n    console.log(`Total Supply with a promise:  ${totalSupply}`);\n}).catch(function(err) {\n    console.log(err);\n});\n\n\n\n\nAsynchronous Operation with Await\n\nNow that you’ve seen the basic tutorial, you can try the same interactions using an asynchronous await construct. Review the web3-contract-basic-interaction-async-await.js script in code/web3js and compare it to this tutorial to see how they differ. Async-await is easier to read, as it makes the asynchronous interaction behave more like a sequence of blocking calls.\n\n\n\n"}}}
