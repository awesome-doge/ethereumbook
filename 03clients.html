<h2 id="ethereum_clients_chapter">Ethereum Clients</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients. Different Ethereum clients <em>interoperate</em> if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols. While these different clients are implemented by different teams and in different programming languages, they all &quot;speak&quot; the same protocol and follow the same rules. As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethereum is an open source project, and the source code for all the major clients is available under open source licenses (e.g., LGPL v3.0), free to download and use for any purpose. <em>Open source</em> means more than simply free to use, though. It also means that Ethereum is developed by an open community of volunteers and can be modified by anyone. More eyes means more trustworthy code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethereum is defined by a formal specification called the &quot;Yellow Paper&quot; (see <a href="#references">[references]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is in contrast to, for example, Bitcoin, which is not defined in any formal way. Where Bitcoin&#x2019;s &quot;specification&quot; is the reference implementation Bitcoin Core, Ethereum&#x2019;s specification is documented in a paper that combines an English and a mathematical (formal) specification. This formal specification, in addition to various Ethereum Improvement Proposals, defines the standard behavior of an Ethereum <span class="keep-together">client</span>. The Yellow Paper is periodically updated as major changes are made to <span class="keep-together">Ethereum</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result of Ethereum&#x2019;s clear formal specification, there are a number of independently developed, yet interoperable, software implementations of an Ethereum client. Ethereum has a greater diversity of implementations running on the network than any other blockchain, which is generally regarded as a good thing. Indeed, it has, for example, proven itself to be an excellent way of defending against attacks on the network, because exploitation of a particular client&#x2019;s implementation strategy simply hassles the developers while they patch the exploit, while other clients keep the network running almost unaffected.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ethereum_networks">Ethereum Networks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There exist a variety of Ethereum-based networks that largely conform to the formal specification defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper, but which may or may not interoperate with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among these Ethereum-based networks are Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ella, Expanse, Ubiq, Musicoin, and many others. While mostly compatible at the protocol level, these networks often have features or attributes that require maintainers of Ethereum client software to make small changes in order to support each network. Because of this, not every version of Ethereum client software runs every Ethereum-based blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, there are six main implementations of the Ethereum protocol, written in six different languages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parity, written in Rust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geth, written in Go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cpp-ethereum, written in C++</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pyethereum, written in Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mantis, written in Scala</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmony, written in Java</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we will look at the two most common clients, Parity and Geth. We&#x2019;ll show how to set up a node using each client, and explore some of their command-line options and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="full_node_importance">Should I Run a Full Node?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains depend on them having many independently operated and geographically dispersed full nodes. Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offering the operator an authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, running a full node will incur a cost in hardware resources and bandwidth. A full node must download 80&#x2013;100 GB of data (as of September 2018, depending on the client configuration) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added. We discuss this topic in greater detail in <a href="#requirements">Hardware Requirements for a Full Node</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A full node running on a live <em>mainnet</em> network is not necessary for Ethereum development. You can do almost everything you need to do with a <em>testnet</em> node (which connects you to one of the smaller public test blockchains), with a local private blockchain like Ganache, or with a cloud-based Ethereum client offered by a service provider like Infura.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also have the option of running a remote client, which does not store a local copy of the blockchain or validate blocks and transactions. These clients offer the functionality of a wallet and can create and broadcast transactions. Remote clients can be used to connect to existing networks, such as your own full node, a public blockchain, a public or permissioned (proof-of-authority) testnet, or a private local blockchain. In practice, you will likely use a remote client such as MetaMask, Emerald Wallet, <span class="keep-together">MyEtherWallet</span>, or MyCrypto as a convenient way to switch between all of the different node options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The terms &quot;remote client&quot; and &quot;wallet&quot; are used interchangeably, though there are some differences. Usually, a remote client offers an API (such as the web3.js API) in addition to the transaction functionality of a wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not confuse the concept of a remote wallet in Ethereum with that of a <em>light client</em> (which is analogous to a Simplified Payment Verification client in Bitcoin). Light clients validate block headers and use Merkle proofs to validate the inclusion of transactions in the blockchain and determine their effects, giving them a similar level of security to a full node. Conversely, Ethereum remote clients do not validate block headers or transactions. They entirely trust a full client to give them access to the blockchain, and hence lose significant security and anonymity guarantees. You can mitigate these problems by using a full client you run yourself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to, but also incurs some mild to moderate costs for you. Let&#x2019;s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks</p>

<h4 id="pub_test_adv_disadv">Public Testnet Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether or not you choose to run a full node, you will probably want to run a public testnet node. Let&#x2019;s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a public testnet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A testnet node needs to sync and store much less data&#x2014;about 10 GB depending on the network (as of April 2018).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A testnet node can sync fully in a few hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploying contracts or making transactions requires test ether, which has no value and can be acquired for free from several &quot;faucets.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testnets are public blockchains with many other users and contracts, running &quot;live.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can&#x2019;t use &quot;real&quot; money on a testnet; it runs on test ether. Consequently, you can&#x2019;t test security against real adversaries, as there is nothing at stake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some aspects of a public blockchain that you cannot test realistically on a testnet. For example, transaction fees, although necessary to send transactions, are not a consideration on a testnet, since gas is free. Further, the testnets do not experience network congestion like the public mainnet sometimes does.</p>

<h4 id="localtest_adv_dis">Local Blockchain Simulation Advantages and Disadvantages</h4>

<p>For many testing purposes, the best option is to launch a single-instance private blockchain. Ganache (formerly named testrpc) is one of the most popular local blockchain simulations that you can interact with, without any other participants.

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>No miners other than you means that mining is more predictable; therefore, you can&#x2019;t test some scenarios that occur on a public blockchain.</p>

<li>
<p>Having no other contracts means you have to deploy everything that you want to test, including dependencies and contract libraries.</p>

<h3 id="running_client">Running an Ethereum Client</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have the time and resources, you should attempt to run a full node, even if only to learn more about the process. In this section we cover how to download, compile, and run the Ethereum clients Parity and Geth. This requires some familiarity with using the command-line interface on your operating system. It&#x2019;s worth installing these clients, whether you choose to run them as full nodes, as testnet nodes, or as clients to a local private blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements">Hardware Requirements for a Full Node</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we get started, you should ensure you have a computer with sufficient resources to run an Ethereum full node. You will need at least 80 GB of disk space to store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain. If you also want to run a full node on the Ethereum testnet, you will need at least an additional 15 GB. Downloading 80 GB of blockchain data can take a long time, so it&#x2019;s recommended that you work on a fast internet connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Syncing the Ethereum blockchain is very input/output (I/O) intensive. It is best to have a solid-state drive (SSD). If you have a mechanical hard disk drive (HDD), you will need at least 8 GB of RAM to use as cache. Otherwise, you may discover that your system is too slow to keep up and sync fully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minimum requirements:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU with 2+ cores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 80 GB free storage space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 GB RAM minimum with an SSD, 8 GB+ if you have an HDD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 MBit/sec download internet service</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the minimum requirements to sync a full (but pruned) copy of an Ethereum-based blockchain.</p>

<p>In many of the examples in this chapter, we will be using the operating system&#x2019;s command-line interface (also known as a &quot;shell&quot;), accessed via a &quot;terminal&quot; application. The shell will display a prompt; you type a command, and the shell responds with some text and a new prompt for your next command. The prompt may look different on your system, but in the following examples, it is denoted by a $ symbol. In the examples, when you see text after a $ symbol, don&#x2019;t type the $ symbol but type the command immediately following it (shown in bold), then press Enter to execute the command. In the examples, the lines below each command are the operating system&#x2019;s responses to that command.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="first_sync">The First Synchronization of Ethereum-Based Blockchains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, when syncing an Ethereum blockchain, your client will download and validate every block and every transaction since the very start&#x2014;i.e., from the genesis block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is possible to fully sync the blockchain this way, the sync will take a very long time and has high resource requirements (it will need much more RAM, and will take a very long time indeed if you don&#x2019;t have fast storage).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many Ethereum-based blockchains were the victim of denial-of-service attacks at the end of 2016. Affected blockchains will tend to sync slowly when doing a full sync.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, on Ethereum, a new client will make rapid progress until it reaches block 2,283,397. This block was mined on September 18, 2016, and marks the beginning of the DoS attacks. From this block to block 2,700,031 (November 26, 2016), the validation of transactions becomes extremely slow, memory intensive, and I/O intensive. This results in validation times exceeding 1 minute per block. Ethereum implemented a series of upgrades, using hard forks, to address the underlying vulnerabilities that were exploited in the DoS attacks. These upgrades also cleaned up the blockchain by removing some 20 million empty accounts created by spam transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are syncing with full validation, your client will slow down and may take several days, or perhaps even longer, to validate the blocks affected by the DoS attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, most Ethereum clients include an option to perform a &quot;fast&quot; synchronization that skips the full validation of transactions until it has synced to the tip of the blockchain, then resumes full validation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Geth, the option to enable fast synchronization is typically called --fast. You may need to refer to the specific instructions for your chosen Ethereum chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parity does fast synchronization by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Geth can only operate fast synchronization when starting with an empty block database. If you have already started syncing without fast mode, Geth cannot switch. It is faster to delete the blockchain data directory and start fast syncing from the beginning than to continue syncing with full validation. Be careful to not delete any wallets when deleting the blockchain data!</p>

<h4 id="json_rpc">The JSON-RPC Interface</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethereum clients offer an application programming interface and a set of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) commands, which are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You will see this referred to as the <em>JSON-RPC API</em>. Essentially, the JSON-RPC API is an interface that allows us to write programs that use an Ethereum client as a <em>gateway</em> to an Ethereum network and blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, the RPC interface is offered as an HTTP service on port 8545. For security reasons it is restricted, by default, to only accept connections from localhost (the IP address of your own computer, which is 127.0.0.1).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To access the JSON-RPC API, you can use a specialized library (written in the programming language of your choice) that provides &quot;stub&quot; function calls corresponding to each available RPC command, or you can manually construct HTTP requests and send/receive JSON-encoded requests. You can even use a generic command-line HTTP client, like curl, to call the RPC interface. Let&#x2019;s try that. First, ensure that you have Geth configured and running, then switch to a new terminal window (e.g., with Ctrl-Shift-N or Ctrl-Shift-T in an existing terminal window) as shown here:</p>
</div>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; --data \
  &apos;{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;web3_clientVersion&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:1}&apos; \
  http://localhost:8545</strong>

{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,
&quot;result&quot;:&quot;Geth/v1.8.0-unstable-02aeb3d7/linux-amd64/go1.8.3&quot;}
</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, we use curl to make an HTTP connection to the address <em><a href="http://localhost:8545" class="bare" target="_blank">http://localhost:8545</a></em>. We are already running geth, which offers the JSON-RPC API as an HTTP service on port 8545. We instruct curl to use the HTTP POST command and to identify the content as type application/json. Finally, we pass a JSON-encoded request as the data component of our HTTP request. Most of our command line is just setting up curl to make the HTTP connection correctly. The interesting part is the actual JSON-RPC command we issue:</p>
</div>
<div id="JSON_RPC_command" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;web3_clientVersion&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:1}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JSON-RPC request is formatted according to the <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification" target="_blank">JSON-RPC 2.0 specification</a>. Each request contains four elements:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">jsonrpc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Version of the JSON-RPC protocol. This MUST be exactly &quot;2.0&quot;.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">method</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the method to be invoked.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">params</dt>
<dd>
<p>A structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">id</dt>
<dd>
<p>An identifier established by the client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. The server MUST reply with the same value in the response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.</p>
</dd>

<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The id parameter is used primarily when you are making multiple requests in a single JSON-RPC call, a practice called <em>batching</em>. Batching is used to avoid the overhead of a new HTTP and TCP connection for every request. In the Ethereum context, for example, we would use batching if we wanted to retrieve thousands of transactions over one HTTP connection. When batching, you set a different id for each request and then match it to the id in each response from the JSON-RPC server. The easiest way to implement this is to maintain a counter and increment the value for each request.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tells us that the JSON-RPC API is being served by Geth client version 1.8.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s try something a bit more interesting. In the next example, we ask the JSON-RPC API for the current price of gas in wei:</p>
</div>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; --data \
  &apos;{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;eth_gasPrice&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:4213}&apos; \

{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:4213,&quot;result&quot;:&quot;0x430e23400&quot;}
</pre>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The response, 0x430e23400, tells us that the current gas price is 18 gwei (gigawei or billion wei). If, like us, you don&#x2019;t think in hexadecimal, you can convert it to decimal on the command line with a little bash-fu:</p>
</div>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>echo $((0x430e23400))</strong>

18000000000

<h3 id="lw_eth_clients">Remote Ethereum Clients</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote clients offer a subset of the functionality of a full client. They do not store the full Ethereum blockchain, so they are faster to set up and require far less data storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>These clients typically provide the ability to do one or more of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create, sign, and broadcast transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interact with smart contracts, using the data payload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browse and interact with DApps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer links to external services such as block explorers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert ether units and retrieve exchange rates from external sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some remote clients, for example mobile (smartphone) wallets, offer only basic wallet functionality. Other remote clients are full-blown DApp browsers. Remote clients commonly offer some of the functions of a full-node Ethereum client without synchronizing a local copy of the Ethereum blockchain by connecting to a full node being run elsewhere, e.g., by you locally on your machine or on a web server, or by a third party on their servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s look at some of the most popular remote clients and the functions they offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="mobile_wallets">Mobile (Smartphone) Wallets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All mobile wallets are remote clients, because smartphones do not have adequate resources to run a full Ethereum client. Light clients are in development and not in general use for Ethereum. In the case of Parity, the light client is marked &quot;experimental&quot; and can be used by running parity with the --light option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Popular mobile wallets include the following (we list these merely as examples; this is not an endorsement or an indication of the security or functionality of these wallets):</p>

<h4 id="browser_wallets">Browser Wallets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of wallets and DApp browsers are available as plug-ins or extensions of web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. These are remote clients that run inside your browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the more popular ones are MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto, and Mist.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="MetaMask">MetaMask</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a>, introduced in <a href="#intro_chapter">[intro_chapter]</a>, is a versatile browser-based wallet, RPC client, and basic contract explorer. It is available on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave Browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike other browser wallets, MetaMask injects a web3 instance into the browser JavaScript context, acting as an RPC client that connects to a variety of Ethereum blockchains (mainnet, Ropsten testnet, Kovan testnet, local RPC node, etc.). The ability to inject a web3 instance and act as a gateway to external RPC services makes MetaMask a very powerful tool for developers and users alike. It can be combined, for example, with MyEtherWallet or MyCrypto, acting as a web3 provider and RPC gateway for those tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="Jaxx">Jaxx</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://jaxx.io" target="_blank">Jaxx</a>, which was introduced as a mobile wallet in the previous section, is also available as a Chrome and Firefox extension and as a desktop wallet.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="MEW">MyEtherWallet (MEW)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/" target="_blank">MyEtherWallet</a> is a browser-based JavaScript remote client that offers:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A software wallet running in JavaScript</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bridge to popular hardware wallets such as the Trezor and Ledger</p>

<li>
<p>A web3 interface that can connect to a web3 instance injected by another client (e.g., MetaMask)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An RPC client that can connect to an Ethereum full client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A basic interface that can interact with smart contracts, given a contract&#x2019;s address and application binary interface (ABI)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MyEtherWallet is very useful for testing and as an interface to hardware wallets. It should not be used as a primary software wallet, as it is exposed to threats via the browser environment and is not a secure key storage system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just prior to the publication of this book, the MyEtherWallet project split into two competing implementations, guided by two independent development teams: a &quot;fork,&quot; as it is called in open source development. The two projects are called MyEtherWallet (the original branding) and <a href="https://mycrypto.com/" target="_blank">MyCrypto</a>. At the time of the split MyCrypto offered identical functionality as MyEtherWallet, but it is likely that the two projects will diverge as the two development teams adopt different goals and priorities.</p>

<h5 id="Mist">Mist</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist" target="_blank">Mist</a> was the first Ethereum-enabled browser, built by the Ethereum Foundation. It contains a browser-based wallet that was the first implementation of the ERC20 token standard (Fabian Vogelsteller, author of ERC20, was also the main developer of Mist). Mist was also the first wallet to introduce the camelCase checksum (EIP-55). Mist runs a full node, and offers a full DApp browser with support for Swarm-based storage and ENS addresses.</p>
