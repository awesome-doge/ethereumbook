<h2 id="tokens_chapter">Tokens</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The word &quot;token&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;t&#x101;cen,&quot; meaning a sign or symbol. It is commonly used to refer to privately issued special-purpose coin-like items of insignificant intrinsic value, such as transportation tokens, laundry tokens, and arcade game tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nowadays, &quot;tokens&quot; administered on blockchains are redefining the word to mean blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that represent assets, currency, or access rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The association between the word &quot;token&quot; and insignificant value has a lot to do with the limited use of the physical versions of tokens. Often restricted to specific businesses, organizations, or locations, physical tokens are not easily exchangeable and typically have only one function. With blockchain tokens, these restrictions are lifted&#x2014;or, more accurately, completely redefinable. Many blockchain tokens serve multiple purposes globally and can be traded for each other or for other currencies on global liquid markets. With the restrictions on use and ownership gone, the &quot;insignificant value&quot; expectation is also a thing of the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we look at various uses for tokens and how they are created. We also discuss attributes of tokens such as fungibility and intrinsicality. Finally, we examine the standards and technologies that they are based on, and experiment by building our own tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="tokens_use">How Tokens Are Used</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most obvious use of tokens is as digital private currencies. However, this is only one possible use. Tokens can be programmed to serve many different functions, often overlapping. For example, a token can simultaneously convey a voting right, an access right, and ownership of a resource. As the following list shows, currency is just the first &quot;app&quot;:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Currency</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can serve as a form of currency, with a value determined through private trade.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Resource</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent a resource earned or produced in a sharing economy or resource-sharing environment; for example, a storage or CPU token representing resources that can be shared over a network.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Asset</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent ownership of an intrinsic or extrinsic, tangible or intangible asset; for example, gold, real estate, a car, oil, energy, MMOG items, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Access</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent access rights and grant access to a digital or physical property, such as a discussion forum, an exclusive website, a hotel room, or a rental car.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Equity</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent shareholder equity in a digital organization (e.g., a DAO) or legal entity (e.g., a corporation).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Voting</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent voting rights in a digital or legal system.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collectible</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent a digital collectible (e.g., CryptoPunks) or physical collectible (e.g., a painting).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent a digital identity (e.g., avatar) or legal identity (e.g., national ID).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Attestation</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can represent a certification or attestation of fact by some authority or by a decentralized reputation system (e.g., marriage record, birth certificate, college degree).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Utility</dt>
<dd>
<p>A token can be used to access or pay for a service.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, a single token encompasses several of these functions. Sometimes it is hard to discern between them, as the physical equivalents have always been inextricably linked. For example, in the physical world, a driver&#x2019;s license (attestation) is also an identity document (identity) and the two cannot be separated. In the digital realm, previously commingled functions can be separated and developed independently (e.g., an anonymous attestation).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="tokens_fungibility">Tokens and Fungibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says: &quot;In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tokens are fungible when we can substitute any single unit of the token for another without any difference in its value or function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strictly speaking, if a token&#x2019;s historical provenance can be tracked, then it is not entirely fungible. The ability to track provenance can lead to blacklisting and whitelisting, reducing or eliminating fungibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-fungible tokens are tokens that each represent a unique tangible or intangible item and therefore are not interchangeable. For example, a token that represents ownership of a <em>specific</em> Van Gogh painting is not equivalent to another token that represents a Picasso, even though they might be part of the same &quot;art ownership token&quot; system. Similarly, a token representing a <em>specific</em> digital collectible such as a specific CryptoKitty is not interchangeable with any other CryptoKitty. Each non-fungible token is associated with a unique identifier, such as a serial number.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will see examples of both fungible and non-fungible tokens later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 id="counterparty_risk">Counterparty Risk</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Counterparty risk is the risk that the <em>other</em> party in a transaction will fail to meet their obligations. Some types of transactions suffer additional counterparty risk because there are more than two parties involved. For example, if you hold a certificate of deposit for a precious metal and you sell that to someone, there are at least three parties in that transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the custodian of the precious metal. Someone holds the physical asset; by necessity they become party to the fulfillment of the transaction and add counterparty risk to any transaction involving that asset. In general, when an asset is traded indirectly through the exchange of a token of ownership, there is additional counterparty risk from the custodian of the asset. Do they have the asset? Will they recognize (or allow) the transfer of ownership based on the transfer of a token (such as a certificate, deed, title, or digital token)? In the world of digital tokens representing assets, as in the nondigital world, it is important to understand who holds the asset that is represented by the token and what rules apply to that underlying asset.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="tokens_intrinsicality">Tokens and Intrinsicality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The word &quot;intrinsic&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;intra,&quot; meaning &quot;from within.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some tokens represent digital items that are intrinsic to the blockchain. Those digital assets are governed by consensus rules, just like the tokens themselves. This has an important implication: tokens that represent intrinsic assets do not carry additional counterparty risk. If you hold the keys for a CryptoKitty, there is no other party holding that CryptoKitty for you&#x2014;you own it directly. The blockchain consensus rules apply and your ownership (i.e., control) of the private keys is equivalent to ownership of the asset, without any intermediary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, many tokens are used to represent <em>extrinsic</em> things, such as real estate, corporate voting shares, trademarks, and gold bars. The ownership of these items, which are not &quot;within&quot; the blockchain, is governed by law, custom, and policy, separate from the consensus rules that govern the token. In other words, token issuers and owners may still depend on real-world non-smart contracts. As a result, these extrinsic assets carry additional counterparty risk because they are held by custodians, recorded in external registries, or controlled by laws and policies outside the blockchain environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important ramifications of blockchain-based tokens is the ability to convert extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets and thereby remove counterparty risk. A good example is moving from equity in a corporation (extrinsic) to an equity or voting token in a <em>DAO</em> or similar (intrinsic) organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="using_tokens">Using Tokens: Utility or Equity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost all projects in Ethereum today launch with some kind of token. But do all these projects really need tokens? Are there any disadvantages to using a token, or will we see the slogan &quot;tokenize all the things&quot; come to fruition? In principle, the use of tokens can be seen as the ultimate management or organization tool. In practice, the integration of blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, into the existing structures of society means that, so far, there are many limitations to their applicability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s start by clarifying the role of a token in a new project. The majority of projects are using tokens in one of two ways: either as &quot;utility tokens&quot; or as &quot;equity tokens.&quot; Very often, those two roles are conflated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Utility tokens are those where the use of the token is required to gain access to a service, application, or resource. Examples of utility tokens include tokens that represent resources such as shared storage, or access to services such as social media networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equity tokens are those that represent shares in the control or ownership of something, such as a startup. Equity tokens can be as limited as nonvoting shares for distribution of dividends and profits, or as expansive as voting shares in a decentralized autonomous organization, where management of the platform is through some complex governance system based on votes by the token holders.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="its_not_duck">It&#x2019;s a Duck!</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many startups face a difficult problem: tokens are a great fundraising mechanism, but offering securities (equity) to the public is a regulated activity in most jurisdictions. By disguising equity tokens as utility tokens, many startups hope to get around these regulatory restrictions and raise money from a public offering while presenting it as a pre-sale of &quot;service access vouchers&quot; or, as we call them, utility tokens. Whether these thinly disguised equity offerings will be able to skirt the regulators remains to be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the popular saying goes: &quot;If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it&#x2019;s a duck.&quot; Regulators are not likely to be distracted by these semantic contortions; quite the opposite, they are more likely to see such legal sophistry as an attempt to deceive the public.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="who_needs_utility_tokens">Utility Tokens: Who Needs Them?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The real problem is that utility tokens introduce significant risks and adoption barriers for startups. Perhaps in a distant future &quot;tokenize all the things&quot; will become reality, but at present the set of people who have an understanding of and desire to use a token is a subset of the already small cryptocurrency market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a startup, each innovation represents a risk and a market filter. Innovation is taking the road least traveled, walking away from the path of tradition. It is already a lonely walk. If a startup is trying to innovate in a new area of technology, such as storage sharing over P2P networks, that is a lonely enough path. Adding a utility token to that innovation and requiring users to adopt tokens in order to use the service compounds the risk and increases the barriers to adoption. It&#x2019;s walking off the already lonely trail of P2P storage innovation and into the wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of each innovation as a filter. It limits adoption to the subset of the market that can become early adopters of this innovation. Adding a second filter compounds that effect, further limiting the addressable market. You are asking your early adopters to adopt not one but two completely new technologies: the novel application/platform/service you built, and the token economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a startup, each innovation introduces risks that increase the chance of failure of the startup. If you take your already risky startup idea and add a utility token, you are adding all the risks of the underlying platform (Ethereum), broader economy (exchanges, liquidity), regulatory environment (equity/commodity regulators), and technology (smart contracts, token standards). That&#x2019;s a lot of risk for a startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advocates of &quot;tokenize all the things&quot; will likely counter that by adopting tokens they are also inheriting the market enthusiasm, early adopters, technology, innovation, and liquidity of the entire token economy. That is true too. The question is whether the benefits and enthusiasm outweigh the risks and uncertainties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, some of the most innovative business ideas are indeed taking place in the crypto realm. If regulators are not quick enough to adopt laws and support new business models, entrepreneurs and associated talent will seek to operate in other jurisdictions that are more crypto-friendly. This is already happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, at the beginning of this chapter, when introducing tokens, we discussed the colloquial meaning of &quot;token&quot; as &quot;something of insignificant value.&quot; The underlying reason for the insignificant value of most tokens is because they can only be used in a very narrow context: one bus company, one laundromat, one arcade, one hotel, or one company store. Limited liquidity, limited applicability, and high conversion costs reduce the value of tokens until they are only of &quot;token&quot; value. So when you add a utility token to your platform, but the token can only be used on your single platform with a small market, you are recreating the conditions that made physical tokens worthless. This may indeed be the correct way to incorporate tokenization into your project. However, if in order to use your platform a user has to convert something into your utility token, use it, and then convert the remainder back into something more generally useful, you&#x2019;ve created a company scrip. The switching costs of a digital token are orders of magnitude lower than for a physical token without a market, but they are not zero. Utility tokens that work across an entire industry sector will be very interesting and probably quite valuable. But if you set up your startup to have to bootstrap an entire industry standard in order to succeed, you may have already failed.</p>

<p>Make this decision for the right reasons. Adopt a token because your application <em>cannot work without a token</em>.

<h3 id="token_std">Tokens on Ethereum</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blockchain tokens existed before Ethereum. In some ways, the first blockchain currency, Bitcoin, is a token itself. Many token platforms were also developed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before Ethereum. However, the introduction of the first token standard on Ethereum led to an explosion of tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vitalik Buterin suggested tokens as one of the most obvious and useful applications of a generalized programmable blockchain such as Ethereum. In fact, in the first year of Ethereum, it was common to see Vitalik and others wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Ethereum logo and a smart contract sample on the back. There were several variations of this T-shirt, but the most common showed an implementation of a token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we delve into the details of creating tokens on Ethereum, it is important to have an overview of how tokens work on Ethereum. Tokens are different from ether because the Ethereum protocol does not know anything about them. Sending ether is an intrinsic action of the Ethereum platform, but sending or even owning tokens is not. The ether balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the protocol level, whereas the token balance of Ethereum accounts is handled at the smart contract level. In order to create a new token on Ethereum, you must create a new smart contract. Once deployed, the smart contract handles everything, including ownership, transfers, and access rights. You can write your smart contract to perform all the necessary actions any way you want, but it is probably wisest to follow an existing standard. We will look at such standards next. We discuss the pros and cons of the following standards at the end of the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ERC20_std">The ERC20 Token Standard</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first standard was introduced in November 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller as an Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC). It was automatically assigned GitHub issue number 20, giving rise to the name &quot;ERC20 token.&quot; The vast majority of tokens are currently based on the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 request for comments eventually became Ethereum Improvement Proposal 20 (EIP-20), but it is mostly still referred to by the original name, ERC20.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ERC20 is a standard for <em>fungible tokens</em>, meaning that different units of an ERC20 token are interchangeable and have no unique properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2CUf7WG" target="_blank">The ERC20 standard</a> defines a common interface for contracts implementing a token, such that any compatible token can be accessed and used in the same way. The interface consists of a number of functions that must be present in every implementation of the standard, as well as some optional functions and attributes that may be added by developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="ERC20_reqd_func">ERC20 required functions and events</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An ERC20-compliant token contract must provide at least the following functions and events:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">totalSupply</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the total units of this token that currently exist. ERC20 tokens can have a fixed or a variable supply.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">balanceOf</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given an address, returns the token balance of that address.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">transfer</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given an address and amount, transfers that amount of tokens to that address, from the balance of the address that executed the transfer.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">transferFrom</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a sender, recipient, and amount, transfers tokens from one account to another. Used in combination with approve.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">approve</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given a recipient address and amount, authorizes that address to execute several transfers up to that amount, from the account that issued the approval.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">allowance</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given an owner address and a spender address, returns the remaining amount that the spender is approved to withdraw from the owner.</p>

</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="ERC20_optional_func">ERC20 optional functions</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the required functions listed in the previous section, the following optional functions are also defined by the standard:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">

<dt class="hdlist1">name</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the human-readable name (e.g., &quot;US Dollars&quot;) of the token.</p>

<div id="ERC20_interface_example" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">contract ERC20 {
   function totalSupply() constant returns (uint theTotalSupply);
   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);
   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns
      (bool success);
   function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);

   event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
   event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="ERC20_data_struct">ERC20 data structures</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you examine any ERC20 implementation you will see that it contains two data structures, one to track balances and one to track allowances. In Solidity, they are implemented with a <em>data mapping</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first data mapping implements an internal table of token balances, by owner. This allows the token contract to keep track of who owns the tokens. Each transfer is a deduction from one balance and an addition to another balance:</p>
</div>
<div id="balance_mapping" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">mapping(address =&gt; uint256) balances;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second data structure is a data mapping of allowances. As we will see in the next section, with ERC20 tokens an owner of a token can delegate authority to a spender, allowing them to spend a specific amount (allowance) from the owner&#x2019;s balance. The ERC20 contract keeps track of the allowances with a two-dimensional mapping, with the primary key being the address of the token owner, mapping to a spender address and an allowance amount:</p>
</div>
<div id="allowance_mapping" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">mapping (address =&gt; mapping (address =&gt; uint256)) public allowed;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="transfer_workflows">ERC20 workflows: &quot;transfer&quot; and &quot;approve &amp; transferFrom&quot;</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ERC20 token standard has two transfer functions. You might be wondering why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ERC20 allows for two different workflows. The first is a single-transaction, straightforward workflow using the transfer function. This workflow is the one used by wallets to send tokens to other wallets. The vast majority of token transactions happen with the transfer workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Executing the transfer contract is very simple. If Alice wants to send 10 tokens to Bob, her wallet sends a transaction to the token contract&#x2019;s address, calling the <span class="keep-together"><code>transfer</code></span> function with Bob&#x2019;s address and 10 as the arguments. The token contract adjusts Alice&#x2019;s balance (&#x2013;10) and Bob&#x2019;s balance (+10) and issues a Transfer event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second workflow is a two-transaction workflow that uses approve followed by transferFrom. This workflow allows a token owner to delegate their control to another address. It is most often used to delegate control to a contract for distribution of tokens, but it can also be used by exchanges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a company is selling tokens for an ICO, they can approve a crowdsale contract address to distribute a certain amount of tokens. The crowdsale contract can then transferFrom the token contract owner&#x2019;s balance to each buyer of the token, as illustrated in <a href="#approve_transferFrom_workflow">The two-step approve &amp; transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. The two-step approve &amp; transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the approve &amp; transferFrom workflow, two transactions are needed. Let&#x2019;s say that Alice wants to allow the AliceICO contract to sell 50% of all the AliceCoin tokens to buyers like Bob and Charlie. First, Alice launches the AliceCoin ERC20 contract, issuing all the AliceCoin to her own address. Then, Alice launches the AliceICO contract that can sell tokens for ether. Next, Alice initiates the approve &amp; transferFrom workflow. She sends a transaction to the AliceCoin contract, calling approve with the address of the AliceICO contract and 50% of the totalSupply as arguments. This will trigger the Approval event. Now, the AliceICO contract can sell AliceCoin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the AliceICO contract receives ether from Bob, it needs to send some AliceCoin to Bob in return. Within the AliceICO contract is an exchange rate between AliceCoin and ether. The exchange rate that Alice set when she created the AliceICO contract determines how many tokens Bob will receive for the amount of ether sent to the AliceICO contract. When the AliceICO contract calls the AliceCoin transferFrom function, it sets Alice&#x2019;s address as the sender and Bob&#x2019;s address as the recipient, and uses the exchange rate to determine how many AliceCoin tokens will be transferred to Bob in the value field. The AliceCoin contract transfers the balance from Alice&#x2019;s address to Bob&#x2019;s address and triggers a Transfer event. The AliceICO contract can call transferFrom an unlimited number of times, as long as it doesn&#x2019;t exceed the approval limit Alice set. The AliceICO contract can keep track of how many AliceCoin tokens it can sell by calling the allowance function.</p>

<p>We can interact with our contract on the ganache blockchain using the Truffle console. This is an interactive JavaScript environment that provides access to the Truffle environment and, via web3, to the blockchain. In this case, we will connect the Truffle console to the ganache blockchain:</p>

<p>The truffle(ganache)&gt; prompt shows that we are connected to the ganache blockchain and are ready to type our commands. The Truffle console supports all the truffle commands, so we could compile and migrate from the console. We&#x2019;ve already run those commands, so let&#x2019;s go directly to the contract itself. The METoken contract exists as a JavaScript object within the Truffle environment. Type **METoken** at the prompt and it will dump the entire contract definition:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alright, we have transferred 1,000 MET to the Faucet contract. Now, how do we withdraw those tokens?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, <em>Faucet.sol</em> is a pretty simple contract. It only has one function, <span class="keep-together"><code>withdraw</code></span>, which is for withdrawing <em>ether</em>. It doesn&#x2019;t have a function for withdrawing MET, or any other ERC20 token. If we use withdraw it will try to send ether, but since Faucet doesn&#x2019;t have a balance of ether yet, it will fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The METoken contract knows that Faucet has a balance, but the only way that it can transfer that balance is if it receives a transfer call from the address of the contract. Somehow we need to make the Faucet contract call the transfer function in <span class="keep-together"><code>METoken</code></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#x2019;re wondering what to do next, don&#x2019;t. There is no solution to this problem. The MET sent to Faucet is stuck, forever. Only the Faucet contract can transfer it, and the Faucet contract doesn&#x2019;t have code to call the transfer function of an ERC20 token contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps you anticipated this problem. Most likely, you didn&#x2019;t. In fact, neither did hundreds of Ethereum users who accidentally transferred various tokens to contracts that didn&#x2019;t have any ERC20 capability. According to some estimates, tokens worth more than roughly $2.5 million USD (at the time of writing) have gotten &quot;stuck&quot; like this and are lost forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the ways that users of ERC20 tokens can inadvertently lose their tokens in a transfer, is when they attempt to transfer to an exchange or another service. They copy an Ethereum address from the website of an exchange, thinking they can simply send tokens to it. However, many exchanges publish receiving addresses that are actually contracts! These contracts are only meant to receive ether, not ERC20 tokens, most often sweeping all funds sent to them to &quot;cold storage&quot; or another centralized wallet. Despite the many warnings saying &quot;do not send tokens to this address,&quot; lots of tokens are lost this way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="transfer_workflow_demo">Demonstrating the &#x201C;approve &amp; transferFrom&#x201D; workflow</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our Faucet contract couldn&#x2019;t handle ERC20 tokens. Sending tokens to it using the transfer function resulted in the loss of those tokens. Let&#x2019;s rewrite the contract now and make it handle ERC20 tokens. Specifically, we will turn it into a faucet that gives out MET to anyone who asks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this example, we&#x2019;ll make a copy of the <em>truffle</em> project directory (we&#x2019;ll call it <em>METoken_METFaucet</em>), initialize truffle and npm, install the OpenZeppelin dependencies, and copy the <em>METoken.sol</em> contract. See our first example, in <a href="#METoken_example">Launching Our Own ERC20 Token</a>, for the detailed instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our new faucet contract, <em>METFaucet.sol</em>, will look like <a href="#METFaucet">METFaucet.sol: A faucet for METoken</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="METFaucet" class="exampleblock">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#x2019;ve made quite a few changes to the basic Faucet example. Since METFaucet will use the transferFrom function in METoken, it will need two additional variables. One will hold the address of the deployed METoken contract. The other will hold the address of the owner of the MET, who will approve the faucet withdrawals. The METFaucet contract will call METoken.transferFrom and instruct it to move MET from the owner to the address where the faucet withdrawal request came from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We declare these two variables here:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">StandardToken public METoken;
address public METOwner;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since our faucet needs to be initialized with the correct addresses for METoken and METOwner, we need to declare a custom constructor:</p>
</div>
<div id="custom_constructor" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">// METFaucet constructor - provide the address of the METoken contract and
// the owner address we will be approved to transferFrom
function METFaucet(address _METoken, address _METOwner) public {

	// Initialize the METoken from the address provided
	METoken = StandardToken(_METoken);
	METOwner = _METOwner;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next change is to the withdraw function. Instead of calling transfer, METFaucet uses the transferFrom function in METoken and asks METoken to transfer MET to the faucet recipient:</p>
</div>
<div id="transfer_met" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">// Use the transferFrom function of METoken
METoken.transferFrom(METOwner, msg.sender, withdraw_amount);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, since our faucet no longer sends ether, we should probably prevent anyone from sending ether to METFaucet, as we wouldn&#x2019;t want it to get stuck. We change the fallback payable function to reject incoming ether, using the revert function to revert any incoming payments:</p>
</div>
<div id="reject_incoming_eth" class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">// REJECT any incoming ether
function () public payable { revert(); }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that our <em>METFaucet.sol</em> code is ready, we need to modify the migration script to deploy it. This migration script will be a bit more complex, as METFaucet depends on the address of METoken. We will use a JavaScript promise to deploy the two contracts in sequence. Create <em>2_deploy_contracts.js</em> as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity">var METoken = artifacts.require(&quot;METoken&quot;);
var METFaucet = artifacts.require(&quot;METFaucet&quot;);
var owner = web3.eth.accounts[0];

module.exports = function(deployer) {

	// Deploy the METoken contract first
	deployer.deploy(METoken, {from: owner}).then(function() {
		// Then deploy METFaucet and pass the address of METoken and the
		// address of the owner of all the MET who will approve METFaucet
		return deployer.deploy(METFaucet, METoken.address, owner);
  	});
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, we can test everything in the Truffle console. First, we use migrate to deploy the contracts. When METoken is deployed it will allocate all the MET to the account that created it, web3.eth.accounts[0]. Then, we call the approve function in <code>METoken</code> to approve METFaucet to send up to 1,000 MET on behalf of web3.eth.accounts[0]. Finally, to test our faucet, we call METFaucet.withdraw from web3.eth.accounts[1] and try to withdraw 10 MET. Here are the console commands:</p>

<p>As you can see from the results, we can use the approve &amp; transferFrom workflow to authorize one contract to transfer tokens defined in another token. If properly used, ERC20 tokens can be used by EOAs and other contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the burden of managing ERC20 tokens correctly is pushed to the user interface. If a user incorrectly attempts to transfer ERC20 tokens to a contract address and that contract is not equipped to receive ERC20 tokens, the tokens will be lost.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ERC20_issues">Issues with ERC20 Tokens</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of the ERC20 token standard has been truly explosive. Thousands of tokens have been launched, both to experiment with new capabilities and to raise funds in various &quot;crowdfund&quot; auctions and ICOs. However, there are some potential pitfalls, as we saw with the issue of transferring tokens to contract addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the less obvious issues with ERC20 tokens is that they expose subtle differences between tokens and ether itself. Where ether is transferred by a transaction that has a recipient address as its destination, token transfers occur within the <em>specific token contract state</em> and have the token contract as their destination, not the recipient&#x2019;s address. The token contract tracks balances and issues events. In a token transfer, no transaction is actually sent to the recipient of the token. Instead, the recipient&#x2019;s address is added to a map within the token contract itself. A transaction sending ether to an address changes the state of an address. A transaction transferring a token to an address only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address. Even a wallet that has support for ERC20 tokens does not become aware of a token balance unless the user explicitly adds a specific token contract to &quot;watch.&quot; Some wallets watch the most popular token contracts to detect balances held by addresses they control, but that&#x2019;s limited to a small fraction of existing ERC20 <span class="keep-together">contracts</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, it&#x2019;s unlikely that a user would <em>want</em> to track all balances in all possible ERC20 token contracts. Many ERC20 tokens are more like email spam than usable tokens. They automatically create balances for accounts that have ether activity, in order to attract users. If you have an Ethereum address with a long history of activity, especially if it was created in the presale, you will find it full of &quot;junk&quot; tokens that appeared out of nowhere. Of course, the address isn&#x2019;t really full of tokens; it&#x2019;s the token contracts that have your address in them. You only see these balances if these token contracts are being watched by the block explorer or wallet you use to view your address.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tokens don&#x2019;t behave the same way as ether. Ether is sent with the send function and accepted by any payable function in a contract or any externally owned address. Tokens are sent using transfer or approve &amp; transferFrom functions that exist only in the ERC20 contract, and do not (at least in ERC20) trigger any payable functions in a recipient contract. Tokens are meant to function just like a cryptocurrency such as ether, but they come with certain differences that break that illusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider another issue. To send ether or use any Ethereum contract you need ether to pay for gas. To send tokens, you <em>also need ether</em>. You cannot pay for a transaction&#x2019;s gas with a token and the token contract can&#x2019;t pay for the gas for you. This may change at some point in the distant future, but in the meantime this can cause some rather strange user experiences. For example, let&#x2019;s say you use an exchange or ShapeShift to convert some bitcoin to a token. You &quot;receive&quot; the token in a wallet that tracks that token&#x2019;s contract and shows your balance. It looks the same as any of the other cryptocurrencies you have in your wallet. Try sending the token, though, and your wallet will inform you that you need ether to do that. You might be confused&#x2014;after all, you didn&#x2019;t need ether to receive the token. Perhaps you have no ether. Perhaps you didn&#x2019;t even know the token was an ERC20 token on Ethereum; maybe you thought it was a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain. The illusion just broke.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these issues are specific to ERC20 tokens. Others are more general issues that relate to abstraction and interface boundaries within Ethereum. Some can be solved by changing the token interface, while others may need changes to fundamental structures within Ethereum (such as the distinction between EOAs and contracts, and between transactions and messages). Some may not be &quot;solvable&quot; exactly and may require user interface design to hide the nuances and make the user experience consistent regardless of the underlying distinctions.</p>

<h4 id="ERC223_std">ERC223: A Proposed Token Contract Interface Standard</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ERC223 proposal attempts to solve the problem of inadvertent transfer of tokens to a contract (that may or may not support tokens) by detecting whether the destination address is a contract or not. ERC223 requires that contracts designed to accept tokens implement a function named tokenFallback. If the destination of a transfer is a contract and the contract does not have support for tokens (i.e., does not implement tokenFallback), the transfer fails.</p>
</div>
<div id="is_contract" class="paragraph">
<p>To detect whether the destination address is a contract, the ERC223 reference implementation uses a small segment of inline bytecode in a rather creative way:</p>

<li>
<p>To enable contracts and addresses to be notified of the tokens&apos; receipt by calling a <code>tokensReceived</code> function in the recipient, and to reduce the probability of tokens being locked into contracts by requiring contracts to provide a <span class="keep-together"><code>tokensReceived</code></span> function</p>

<p>An important aspect is that only one token sender and one token recipient can be registered per address.

<h4 id="erc721">ERC721: Non-fungible Token (Deed) Standard</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the token standards we have looked at so far are for <em>fungible</em> tokens, meaning that units of a token are interchangeable. The ERC20 token standard only tracks the final balance of each account and does not (explicitly) track the provenance of any token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2Ogs7Im" target="_blank">ERC721 proposal</a> is for a standard for <em>non-fungible</em> tokens, also known as <em>deeds</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the Oxford Dictionary:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>deed</em>: A legal document that is signed and delivered, especially one regarding the ownership of property or legal rights.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the word &quot;deed&quot; is intended to reflect the &quot;ownership of property&quot; part, even though these are not recognized as &quot;legal documents&quot; in any jurisdiction&#x2014;yet. It is likely that at some point in the future, legal ownership based on digital signatures on a blockchain platform will be legally recognized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-fungible tokens track ownership of a unique thing. The thing owned can be a digital item, such as an in-game item or digital collectible; or the thing can be a physical item whose ownership is tracked by a token, such as a house, a car, or an artwork. Deeds can also represent things with negative value, such as loans (debt), liens, easements, etc. The ERC721 standard places no limitation or expectation on the nature of the thing whose ownership is tracked by a deed and requires only that it can be uniquely identified, which in the case of this standard is achieved by a 256-bit <span class="keep-together">identifier</span>.</p>

<h3 id="token_std_review">Using Token Standards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous section we reviewed several proposed standards and a couple of widely deployed standards for token contracts. What exactly do these standards do? Should you use these standards? How should you use them? Should you add functionality beyond these standards? Which standards should you use? We will examine some of those questions next.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="token_std_purpose">What Are Token Standards? What Is Their Purpose?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Token standards are the <em>minimum</em> specifications for an implementation. What that means is that in order to be compliant with, say, ERC20, you need to at minimum implement the functions and behavior specified by the ERC20 standard. You are also free to <em>add</em> to the functionality by implementing functions that are not part of the standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary purpose of these standards is to encourage <em>interoperability</em> between contracts. Thus, all wallets, exchanges, user interfaces, and other infrastructure components can <em>interface</em> in a predictable manner with any contract that follows the specification. In other words, if you deploy a contract that follows the ERC20 standard, all existing wallet users can seamlessly start trading your token without any wallet upgrade or effort on your part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standards are meant to be <em>descriptive</em>, rather than <em>prescriptive</em>. How you choose to implement those functions is up to you&#x2014;the internal functioning of the contract is not relevant to the standard. They have some functional requirements, which govern the behavior under specific circumstances, but they do not prescribe an implementation. An example of this is the behavior of a transfer function if the value is set to zero.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="should_use_std">Should You Use These Standards?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given all these standards, each developer faces a dilemma: use the existing standards or innovate beyond the restrictions they impose?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This dilemma is not easy to resolve. Standards necessarily restrict your ability to innovate, by creating a narrow &quot;rut&quot; that you have to follow. On the other hand, the basic standards have emerged from experience with hundreds of applications and often fit well with the vast majority of use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of this consideration is an even bigger issue: the value of interoperability and broad adoption. If you choose to use an existing standard, you gain the value of all the systems designed to work with that standard. If you choose to depart from the standard, you have to consider the cost of building all of the support infrastructure on your own, or persuading others to support your implementation as a new standard. The tendency to forge your own path and ignore existing standards is known as &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome and is antithetical to open source culture. On the other hand, progress and innovation depend on departing from tradition sometimes. It&#x2019;s a tricky choice, so consider it carefully!</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="security_maturity">Security by Maturity</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the choice of standard, there is the parallel choice of <em>implementation</em>. When you decide to use a standard such as ERC20, you have to then decide how to implement a compatible design. There are a number of existing &quot;reference&quot; implementations that are widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem, or you could write your own from scratch. Again, this choice represents a dilemma that can have serious security implications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Existing implementations are &#x201C;battle-tested.&#x201D; While it is impossible to prove that they are secure, many of them underpin millions of dollars&apos; worth of tokens. They have been attacked, repeatedly and vigorously. So far, no significant vulnerabilities have been discovered. Writing your own is not easy&#x2014;there are many subtle ways that a contract can be compromised. It is much safer to use a well-tested, widely used implementation. In our examples, we used the OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC20 standard, as this implementation is security-focused from the ground up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use an existing implementation you can also extend it. Again, however, be careful with this impulse. Complexity is the enemy of security. Every single line of code you add expands the <em>attack surface</em> of your contract and could represent a vulnerability lying in wait. You may not notice a problem until you put a lot of value on top of the contract and someone breaks it.</p>

<h3 id="extend_token_interface">Extensions to Token Interface Standards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The token standards discussed in this chapter provide a very minimal interface, with limited functionality. Many projects have created extended implementations to support features that they need for their applications. Some of these features include:</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Owner control</dt>

<dt class="hdlist1">Burning</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to deliberately destroy (&#x201C;burn&#x201D;) tokens by transferring them to an unspendable address or by erasing a balance and reducing the supply.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Minting</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to add to the total supply of tokens, at a predictable rate or by &quot;fiat&quot; of the creator of the token.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Crowdfunding</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to offer tokens for sale, for example through an auction, market sale, reverse auction, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Caps</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to set predefined and immutable limits on the total supply (the opposite of the &quot;minting&quot; feature).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Recovery backdoors</dt>
<dd>
<p>Functions to recover funds, reverse transfers, or dismantle the token that can be activated by a designated address or set of addresses.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Whitelisting</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to restrict actions (such as token transfers) to specific addresses. Most commonly used to offer tokens to &quot;accredited investors&quot; after vetting by the rules of different jurisdictions. There is usually a mechanism for updating the whitelist.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Blacklisting</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability to restrict token transfers by disallowing specific addresses. There is usually a function for updating the blacklist.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are reference implementations for many of these functions, for example in the OpenZeppelin library. Some of these are use case&#x2013;specific and only implemented in a few tokens. There are, as of now, no widely accepted standards for the interfaces to these functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As previously discussed, the decision to extend a token standard with additional functionality represents a trade-off between innovation/risk and interoperability/security.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="tokens_ico">Tokens and ICOs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tokens have been an explosive development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is likely that they will become a very important component of all smart contract platforms like Ethereum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, the importance and future impact of these standards should not be confused with an endorsement of current token offerings. As in any early-stage technology, the first wave of products and companies will almost all fail, and some will fail spectacularly. Many of the tokens on offer in Ethereum today are barely disguised scams, pyramid schemes, and money grabs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trick is to separate the long-term vision and impact of this technology, which is likely to be huge, from the short-term bubble of token ICOs, which are rife with fraud. Token standards and the platform will survive the current token mania, and then they will likely change the world.</p>
