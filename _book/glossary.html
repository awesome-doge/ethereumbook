</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Account</dt>
<dd>
<p>An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Address</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most generally, this represents an EOA or contract that can receive (destination address) or send (source address) transactions on the blockchain. More specifically, it is the rightmost 160 bits of a Keccak hash of an ECDSA public key.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Assert</dt>
<dd>
<p>In Solidity, assert(false) compiles to 0xfe, an invalid opcode, which uses up all remaining gas and reverts all changes. When an assert() statement fails, something very wrong and unexpected is happening, and you will need to fix your code. You should use assert() to avoid conditions that should never, ever occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Big-endian</dt>
<dd>
<p>A positional number representation where the most significant digit is first. The opposite of little-endian, where the least significant digit is first.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">BIPs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.  A set of proposals that members of the Bitcoin community have submitted to improve Bitcoin. For example, BIP-21 is a proposal to improve the Bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Block</dt>
<dd>
<p>A collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised transactions, and a set of other block headers known as ommers. Blocks are added to the Ethereum network by miners.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Blockchain</dt>
<dd>
<p>In Ethereum, a sequence of blocks validated by the proof-of-work system, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block. This varies from the Bitcoin protocol in that it does not have a block size limit; it instead uses varying gas limits.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Bytecode</dt>
<dd>
<p>An abstract instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed in numeric format.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Byzantium fork</dt>
<dd>
<p>The first of two hard forks for the Metropolis development stage. It included EIP-649: Metropolis Difficulty Bomb Delay and Block Reward Reduction, where the Ice Age (see below) was delayed by 1 year and the block reward was reduced from 5 to 3 ether.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Compiling</dt>
<dd>
<p>Converting code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity) into a lower-level language (e.g., EVM bytecode).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Consensus</dt>
<dd>
<p>When numerous nodes&#x2014;usually most nodes on the network&#x2014;all have the same blocks in their locally validated best blockchain. Not to be confused with consensus rules.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Consensus rules</dt>
<dd>
<p>The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes. Not to be confused with consensus.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Constantinople fork</dt>
<dd>
<p>The second part of the Metropolis stage, originally planned for mid-2018. Expected to include a switch to a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, among other changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Contract account</dt>
<dd>
<p>An account containing code that executes whenever it receives a transaction from another account (EOA or contract).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Contract creation transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>A special transaction, with the &quot;zero address&quot; as the recipient, that is used to register a contract and record it on the Ethereum blockchain (see &quot;zero address&quot;).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DAO</dt>
<dd>
<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A company or other organization that operates without hierarchical management. Also may refer to a contract named &quot;The DAO&quot; launched on April 30, 2016, which was then hacked in June 2016; this ultimately motivated a hard fork (codenamed DAO) at block #1,192,000, which reversed the hacked DAO contract and caused Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to split into two competing systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DApp</dt>
<dd>
<p>Decentralized application. At a minimum, it is a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services. In addition, many DApps include decentralized storage and/or a message protocol and platform.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Deed</dt>
<dd>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) standard introduced by the ERC721 proposal. Unlike ERC20 tokens, deeds prove ownership and are not interchangeable, though they are not recognized as legal documents in any jurisdiction&#x2014;at least not currently (see also &quot;NFT&quot;).</p>
